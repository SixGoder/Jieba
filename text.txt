Introduction
TO THE STUDENT
About the book
This book has been written for candidates preparing for the revised version of the International English Language Testing System, known as IELTS. This is a test designed to assess the English language skills of non-English speaking students seeking to study in an English speaking country. Aims of the book
— to prepare you for the test by familiarising you with the types of texts and tasks that you will meet in the IELTS test, and the level and style of language used in the test. — to help you prepare for your studies at university or college by introducing you to the types of communication tasks which you are likely to meet in English speaking study environment.
Content of the book
The book contains four complete sample IELTS tests, each comprising Listening and Speaking modules and Academic Reading and Writing modules. In addition there is one set of the General Training Reading and Writing modules. (NB all candidates do the same Listening and Speaking modules.) To accompany the tests there is an answer key at the back of the book and you should refer to this after you have attempted each of the practice tests. Also included is an annotated copy of the listening tapescripts with the appropriate sections highlighted to help you to check your answers. In addition, you will find one model answer for each type of writing task to guide you with your writing. There is a comprehensive key for the Reading and Listening sections, but if you are in any doubt about your answers, talk to a teacher or an English speaking friend. Where you are required to answer in your own words, the answer must be accurate in both meaning as well as grammar in order to be scored correct. Benefits of studying for IELTS
By studying for IELTS you will not only be preparing for the test but also for your future as a student in an English speaking environment. The test is designed to assess your ability to understand and produce written and spoken language in an educational context. The book makes reference to the ways in which university study is organised in many English speaking countries and the types of academic tasks you will be expected to perform.

Introdution
The Speaking Module
How is IELTS scored?
IELTS provides a profile of your ability to use English. In other words your IELTS result will consist of a score in each of the four skills (listening, reading, writing, speaking) which is then averaged to give the Overall Band Score or final mark. Performance is rated in each skill on a scale of 9 to 1. The nine overall Bands and their descriptive statements are as follows:
9 Expert user Has fully operational command of the language: appropriate, accurate and fluent with complete understanding.
8 Very good user Has fully operational command of the language with only occasional unsystematic inaccuracies and inappropriacies. Misunderstandings may occur in unfamiliar situations. Handles complex detailed argumentation well.
Requirements
You will have to talk to an examiner for about 15 minutes. The interview will be recorded. It is in 5 parts:
1 Introduction — Basic introductions
2 Extended discourse — You will talk at some length about general topics of relevance or interest which will involve explanation and description.
3 Elicitation — You will be given a cue card which describes a situation or problem. You must ask the examiner questions to obtain information.
4 Speculation and attitudes — You will be asked to talk about your plans or proposed course of study. You should demonstrate your ability to speculate or defend a point of view.
5 Conclusion — The interview comes to an end.
Assessment criteria
You will be assessed on the following criteria: • ability to communicate effectively • ability to use appropriate vocabulary and structures • ability to ask questions • ability to take initiative in a conversation • general fluency • structural accuracy • intelligibility

Introdution
7 Good user Has operational command of the language, though with occasional inaccuracies, inappropriacies and misunderstandings in some situations. Generally handles complex language well and understands detailed reasoning.
6 Competent user Has generally effective command of the language despite inaccuracies, inappropriacies and misunderstandings. Can use and understand fairly complex language, particularly in familiar situations.
5 Modest user Has partial command of the language, coping with overall meaning in most situations, though is likely to make many mistakes. Should be able to handle basic communication in own field.
4 Limited user Basic competence is limited to familiar situations. Has frequent problems in understanding and expression. Is not able to use complex language.
3 Extremely limited user Conveys and understands only general meaning in very familiar situations. Frequent breakdowns in communication occur.
2 Intermittent user No real communication is possible except for the most basic information using isolated words or short formulae in familiar situations and to meet immediate needs. Has great difficulty understanding spoken and written English.
1 Non user Essentially has no ability to use the language beyond possibly a few isolated words.
0 Did not attempt the test No assessable information provided.
What is the pass mark?
There is no fixed pass mark in IELTS. The institution you want to enter will decide whether your score is appropriate for the demands of the course of study or training you want to undertake. However, as a general rule, scores below Band 5 in any one skill are considered too low for academic

Introdution
study; scores above Band 6 are deemed to be adequate to good. Overall Band scores of 5 or 6 are borderline and may not be acceptable at many institutions. If you are getting only about half of the questions in these sample tests correct, then you are probably not quite ready to take the IELTS test. Again you should seek advice from a teacher about your level of English. Remember you must allow a duration of at least 3 months between each attempt at the test.
For further information about the test, see the IELTS Handbook available from all test centres and also from UCLES (University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate), from I DP Education Australia and from British Council Centres.
HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
The tests in this book are similar in length, format and content to the real test, but success in these tests will not guarantee success in the real test. It often seems easier to work on practice materials than to sit the tests themselves because you are not under the same pressure.
Timing
In order to maximise your use of these tests, you should make a note of the time it takes you to answer each of the sections. As you progress through the book, be stricter with yourself about the time you allow yourself to complete the sections.
Answer sheets
When you sit for the real IELTS test, you will have answer sheets on which to write your answers. A sample of these is given at the end of this book. To help you prepare for the test, we suggest that you write your answers on separate sheets of paper, rather than in the book itself.
Answer keys
Listening
In addition to the answer key, you will find tapescripts for all of the listening passages. These have been annotated to show where in the text the answer to each question can be found. There is very often a signpost word which will cue your listening. Look out for these signposts. Remember, the answers are usually short and never more than three words. Read the questions carefully, in the time provided on the tape, before you listen to each section of the tape.
10
Introdution
Reading You will meet a number of different question types in the IELTS test. It is a useful strategy to become familiar with them and learn how best to approach them. The answer keys at the back of this book not only provide you with the answer to each question, but also give a suggested approach to each type of question, so take the time to work through them carefully.
Writing
You will find four sample answers to the writing tasks, one for each task type on each module. These have been included to give you an idea of the type of writing expected. However, there will be alternative approaches to each question and the model answers given should not be seen as prescriptive. Look carefully at the description of the writing test (given above in the Introduction) to see exactly which criteria you should be paying attention to in each task.
Speaking
The sample speaking tasks are to help you prepare for part 3 of the Speaking test. Remember that the examiner will expect you to show how much English you know and it is up to you to demonstrate that. You are expected to ask a lot of questions in part 3 and the examiner will not speak very much and may even appear to be “unhelpful” at times, to encourage you to ask more questions. The sample speaking tasks include suggested examiner’s prompts so that you can see how the interaction might unfold. It may be a useful preparation strategy to work with a friend and practise the interview format in this way, using the sample tasks in the book.

READING PASSAGE 1
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-15 which are based on Reading Passage 1 below
A spark, a flint: How fire leapt to life
The control of fire was the first and perhaps greatest of   humanity’s steps towards a life-enhancing technology
To early man, fire was a divine gift randomly delivered in the form of lightning, forest fire or burning lava. Unable to make flame for themselves, the earliest peoples probabh stored fire by keeping slow burning logs alight or by carrying charcoal in pots.
How and where man learnt how to produce flame at will is unknown. It was probably a secondary invention, accidentally made during tool-making operations with wood or stone. Studies of primitive societies suggest that the earliest method of making fire was through friction. European peasants would insert a wooden drill in a round hole and rotate it briskly between their palms This process could be speeded up by wrapping a cord around the drill and pulling on each end.
The Ancient Greeks used lenses or concave mirrors to concentrate the sun’s rays and burning
 glasses were also used by Mexican Aztecs and the Chinese.
Percussion methods of firelighting date back to Paleolithic times, when some Stone Age tool-makers discovered that chipping  flints produced sparks. The technique became more efficient after the discovery of iron, about 5000 vears ago In Arctic North America, the Eskimos produced a slow-burning spark by striking quartz against iron pyrites, a compound that contains sulphur. The Chinese lit their fires by striking porcelain with bamboo. In Europe, the combination of steel, flint and tinder remained the main method of firelighting until the mid 19th century.
Fire-lighting was revolutionised by the discovery of phosphorus, isolated in 1669 by a German alchemist trying to transmute silver into gold. Impressed by the element’s combustibility, several 17th century chemists used it to manufacture fire-lighting devices, but the results were dangerously inflammable. With phosphorus costing the
Reading
eqimalent of several hundred pounds per ounce, the hrst matches were expensive.
The quest for a practical match really began after 1781 when a group of French chemists came up with the Phosphoric Candle or Ethereal Match, a sealed glass tube containing a twist of paper tipped with phosphorus. When the tube was broken, air rushed in, causing the phosphorus to selfcombust. An even more hazardous device, popular in America, was the Instantaneous Light Box — a bottle filled with sulphuric acid into which splints treated with chemicals were dipped.
The first matches resembling those used today were made in 1827 by John Walker, an English pharmacist who borrowed the formula from a military rocket-maker called Congreve. Costing a shilling a box, Congreves were splints coated with sulphur and tipped with potassium chlorate. To light them, the user drew them quickly through folded glass paper.
Walker never patented his invention, and three years later it was copied by a Samuel Jones, who marketed his product as Lucifers. About the same time, a French chemistry student called Charles Sauria produced the first “strike-anywhere” match by substituting white phosphorus for the potassium chlorate in the Walker formula. However, since white phosphorus is a deadly poison, from 1845 match-makers exposed to its fumes succumbed to necrosis, a disease that eats away jaw-bones. It wasn’t until 1906 that the substance was eventually banned.
That was 62 years after a Swedish chemist called Pasch had discovered non-toxic red or amorphous phosphorus, a development exploited commercially by Pasch’s compatriot J E Lundstrom in 1885. Lundstrom’s safety matches were safe because the red phosphorus was non-toxic; it was painted on to the striking surface instead of the match tip, which contained potassium chlorate with a relatively high ignition temperature of 182 degrees centigrade.
America lagged behind Europe in match technology and safety standards. It wasn’t until 1900 that the Diamond Match Company bought a French patent for safety matches — but the formula did not work properly in the different climatic conditions prevailing in America and it was another 11 years before scientists finally adapted the French patent for the US.
The Americans, however, can claim several “firsts” in match technology and marketing. In 1892 the Diamond Match Company pioneered book matches. The innovation didn’t catch on until after 1896, when a brewery had the novel idea of advertising its product in match books. Today book matches are the most widely used type in the US, with 90 percent handed out free by hotels, restaurants and others.
Other American innovations include an antiafterglow solution to prevent the match from smouldering after it has been blown out; and the waterproof match, which lights after eight hours in water.

Practice Test 1
READING PASSAGE 2
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 16-28 which are based on Reading Passage 2 below. Zoo  conservation  programmes
One of London Zoo’s recent advertisements caused me some irritation, so patently did it distort reality. Headlined “Without zoos you might as well tell these animals to get stuffed”, it was bordered with illustrations of several endangered species and went on to extol the myth that without zoos like London Zoo these animals “will almost certainly disappear forever”. With the zoo world’s rather mediocre record on conservation, one might be forgiven for being slightly sceptical about such an advertisement.
Zoos were originally created as places of entertainment, and their suggested involvement with conservation didn’t seriously arise until about 30 years ago, when the Zoological Society of London held the first formal international meeting on the subject. Eight years later, a series of world conferences took place, entitled “The Breeding of Endangered Species”, and from this point onwards conservation became the zoo community’s buzzword. This commitment has now been clearh defined in The World Zpo Conservation Strategy (WZGS, September 1993), which although an important and welcome document does seem to be based on an unrealistic optimism about the nature of the zoo industry
The WZCS estimates that there are about 10,000 zoos in the world, of which around 1,000 represent a core of quality collections capable of participating in co-ordinated conservation programmes. This is probably the document’s first failing, as I believe that 10,000 is a serious underestimate of the total number of places masquerading as zoological establishments. Of course it is difficult to get accurate data but, to put the issue into perspective, I have found that, in a year of working in Eastern Europe, I discover fresh zoos on almost a weekly basis.
The second flaw in the reasoning of the WZCS document is the naive faith it places in its 1,000 core zoos. One would assume that the calibre of these institutions would have been carefully examined, but it appears that the criterion for inclusion on this select list might merely be that the zoo is a member of a zoo federation or association. This might be a good starting point, working on the premise that members must meet certain standards, but again the facts don’t support the theory. The greatly respected American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (AAZPA) has had extremely dubious members, and in the UK the Federation of Zoological Gardens of Great Britain and Ireland has
Reading
occasionally had members that have been roundly censured in the national press. These include Robin Hill Adventure Park on the Isle of Wight, which many considered the most notorious collection of animals in the country. This establishment, which for years was protected by the Isle’s local council (which viewed it as a tourist amenity), was finally closed down following a damning report by a veterinary inspector appointed under the terms of the Zoo Licensing Act 1981. As it was always a collection of dubious repute, one is obliged to reflect upon the standards that the Zoo Federation sets when granting membership. The situation is even worse in developing countries where little money is available for redevelopment and it is hard to see a way of incorporating collections into the overall scheme of the WZCS.
Even assuming that the WZCS’s 1,000 core zoos are all of a high standard complete with scientific staff and research facilities, trained and dedicated keepers, accommodation that permits normal or natural behaviour, and a policy of co-operating fully with one another  what might be the potential for conservation? Colin Tudge, author of Last Animals at the Zoo (Oxford University Press, 1992), argues that “if the world”s zoos worked together in co-operative breeding programmes, then even without further expansion they could save around 2,000 species of endangered land vertebrates’. This seems an extremely optimistic proposition from a man who must be aware of the failings and weaknesses of the zoo industry the man who, when a member of the council of London Zoo, had to persuade the zoo to devote more of its activities to conservation. Moreover, where are the facts to support such optimism?
Today approximately 16 species might be said to have been “saved” by captive breeding programmes, although a number of these can hardly be looked upon as resounding successes. Beyond that, about a further 20 species are being seriously considered for zoo conservation programmes. Given that the international conference at London Zoo was held 30 years ago, this is pretty slow progress, and a long way off Tudge’s target of 2,000.

READING PASSAGE 3
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 29-40 which are based on Reading Passage 3 below. ARCHITECTURE - Reaching for the Sky Architecture is the art and science of designing buildings and structures. A building reflects the scientific and technological achievements of the age as well as the ideas and aspirations of the designer and client. The appearance of individual buildings, however, is often controversial. The use of an architectural style cannot be said to start or finish on a specific date. Neither is it possible to say exactly what characterises a particular movement. But the origins of what is now generally known as modern architecture can be traced back to the social and technological changes of the 18th and 19th centuries. Instead of using timber, stone and traditional building techniques, architects began to explore ways of creating buildings by using the latest technology and materials such as steel, glass and concrete strengthened steel bars, known as reinforced concrete. Technological advances also helped bring about the decline of rural industries and an increase in urban populations as people moved to the towns to work in the new factories. Such rapid and uncontrolled growth helped to turn parts of cities into slums. By the 1920s architects throughout Europe were reacting against the conditions created by industrialisation. A new style of architecture emerged to reflect more idealistic notions for the future. It was made possible by new materials and construction techniques and was known as Modernism. By the 1930s many buildings emerging from this movement were designed in the International Style. This was largely characterised by the bold use of new materials and simple, geometric forms, often with white walls supported by stiltlike pillars. These were stripped of unnecessary decoration that would detract from their primary purpose — to be used or lived in. Walter Gropius, Charles Jeanneret (better known as Le Corbusier) and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe were among the most influential of the many architects who contributed to the development of Modernism in the first half of the century. But the economic depression of the 1930s and the second world war (1939-45) prevented their ideas from being widely realised until the economic conditions improved and war-torn cities had to be rebuilt. By the 1950s, the International Style had developed into a universal approach to building, which standardised the appearance of new buildings in cities across the world. Unfortunately, this Modernist interest in geometric simplicity and function became exploited for profit. The rediscovery of quick-and-easy-to-handle reinforced concrete and an improved ability to prefabricate building sections meant that builders could meet the budgets of commissioning authorities and handle a renewed demand for development quickly and cheaply. But this led to many badly designed buildings, which discredited the original aims of Modernism. Influenced by Le Corbusier’s ideas on town planning, every large British city built multi-storey housing estates in the 1960s. Massproduced, low-cost high-rises seemed to offer a solution to the problem of housing a growing inner-city population. But far from meeting human needs, the new estates often proved to be windswept deserts lacking essential social facilities and services. Many of these buildings were poorly designed and constructed and have since been demolished. By the 1970s, a new respect for the place of buildings within the existing townscape arose. Preserving historic buildings or keeping only their facades (or fronts) grew common. Architects also began to make more use of building styles and materials that were traditional to the area. The architectural style usually referred to as High Tech was also emerging. It

celebrated scientific and engineering achievements by openly parading the sophisticated techniques used in construction. Such buildings are commonly made of metal and glass; examples are Stansted airport and the Lloyd’s building in London. Disillusionment at the failure of many of the poor imitations of Modernist architecture led to interest in various styles and ideas from the past and present. By the 1980s the coexistence of
different styles of architecture in the same building became known as Post Modern. Other architects looked back to the classical tradition. The trend in architecture now favours smaller scale building design that reflects a growing public awareness of environmental issues such as energy efficiency. Like the Modernists, people today recognise that a well designed environment improves the quality of life but is not necessarily achieved by adopting one well defined style of architecture.
Twentieth century architecture will mainly be remembered for its tall buildings. They have been made possible by the development of light steel frames and safe passenger lifts. They originated in the US over a century ago to help meet the demand for more economical use of land. As construction techniques improved, the skyscraper became a reality.

READING PASSAGE 1
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-12 which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.
Right and left-handedness in humans
Why do humans, virtually alone among all animal species, display a distinct left or right-handedness? Not even our closest relatives among the apes possess such decided lateral asymmetry, as psychologists call it. Yet about 90 per cent of every human population that has ever lived appears to have been right-handed. Professor Bryan Turner at Deakin University has studied the research literature on left-handedness and found that handedness goes with sidedness. So nine out of ten people are right-handed and eight are right-footed. He noted that this distinctive asymmetry in the human population is itself systematic. “Humans think in categories: black and white, up and down, left and right. It”s a system of signs that enables us to categorise phenomena that are essentially ambiguous.’
Research has shown that there is a genetic or inherited element to handedness. But while left-handedness tends to run in families, neither left nor right handers will automatically produce off-spring with the same handedness; in fact about 6 per cent of children with two right-handed parents will be left-handed. However, among two left-handed parents, perhaps 40 per cent of the children will also be left-handed. With one right and one left-handed parent, 15 to 20 per cent of the offspring will be left
handed. Even among identical twins who have exactly the same genes, one in six pairs will differ in their handedness.
What then makes people left-handed if it is not simply genetic? Other factors must be at work and researchers have turned to the brain for clues. In the 1860s the French surgeon and anthropologist, Dr Paul Broca, made the remarkable finding that patients who had lost their powers of speech as a result of a stroke (a blood clot in the brain) had paralysis of the right half of their body. He noted that since the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right half of the body, and vice versa, the brain damage must have been in the brain’s left hemisphere. Psychologists now believe that among right-handed people, probably 95 per cent have their language centre in the left hemisphere, while 5 per cent have rightsided language. Left-handers, however, do not show the reverse pattern but instead a majority also have their language in the left hemisphere. Some 30 per cent have right hemisphere language.
Dr Brinkman, a brain researcher at the Australian National University in Canberra, has suggested that evolution of speech went with right-handed preference. According to Brinkman, as the brain evolved, one side
41
Reading
became specialised for fine control of movement (necessary for producing speech) and along with this evolution came righthand preference. According to Brinkman, most left-handers have left hemisphere dominance but also some capacity in the right hemisphere. She has observed that if a left-handed person is brain-damaged in the left hemisphere, the recovery of speech is quite often better and this is explained by the fact that left-handers have a more bilateral speech function.
In her studies of macaque monkeys, Brinkman has noticed that primates (monkeys) seem to learn a hand preference from their mother in the first year of life but this could be one hand or the other. In humans, however, the specialisation in (unction of the two hemispheres results in anatomical differences: areas that are involved with the production of speech are usually larger on the left side than on the right. Since monkeys have not acquired the art of speech, one would not expect to see such a variation but Brinkman claims to have discovered a trend in monkeys towards the asymmetry that is evident in the human brain.
Two American researchers, Geschwind and Galaburda, studied the brains of human embryos and discovered that the left-right asymmetry exists before birth. But as the brain develops, a number of things can affect it. Every brain is initially female in its organisation and it only becomes a male brain when the male foetus begins to secrete hormones. Geschwind and Galaburda knew that different parts of the brain mature at different rates; the right hemisphere develops first, then the left. Moreover, a girl’s brain develops somewhat faster than
that of a boy. So, if something happens to the brain’s development during pregnancy, it is more likely to be affected in a male and the hemisphere more likely to be involved is the left. The brain may become less lateralised and this in turn could result in left-handedness and the development of certain superior skills that have their origins in the left hemisphere such as logic, rationality and abstraction. It should be no surprise then that among mathematicians and architects, left-handers tend to be more common and there are more left-handed males than females.
The results of this research may be some consolation to left-handers who have for centuries lived in a world designed to suit right-handed people. However, what is alarming, according to Mr. Charles Moore, a writer and journalist, is the way the word “right” reinforces its own virtue. Subliminally he says, language tells people to think that anything on the right can be trusted while anything on the left is dangerous or even sinister. We speak of lefthanded compliments and according to Moore, “it is no coincidence that lefthanded children, forced to use their right hand, often develop a stammer as they are robbed of their freedom of speech”. However, as more research is undertaken on the causes of left-handedness, attitudes towards left-handed people are gradually changing for the better. Indeed when the champion tennis player Ivan Lendl was asked what the single thing was that he would choose in order to improve his game, he said he would like to become a lefthander.

2 below.
MIGRATORY BEEKEEPING
Taking Wing To eke out a full-time living from their honeybees, about half the nation’s 2,000 commercial beekeepers pull up stakes each spring, migrating north to find more flowers for their bees. Besides turning floral nectar into honey, these hardworking insects also pollinate crops for farmers -for a fee. As autumn approaches, the beekeepers pack up their hives and go south, scrambling for pollination contracts in hot spots like California’s fertile Central Valley.
Of the 2,000 commercial beekeepers in the United States about half migrate This pays off in two ways Moving north in the summer and south in the winter lets bees work a longer blooming season, making more honey — and
money — for their keepers. Second, beekeepers can carry their hives to farmers who need bees to pollinate their crops. Every spring a migratory beekeeper in California may move up to 160 million bees to
45
Rreading
flowering fields in Minnesota and every winter his family may haul the hives back to California, where farmers will rent the bees to pollinate almond and cherry trees. Migratory beekeeping is nothing new. The ancient Egyptians moved clay hives, probably on rafts, down the Nile to follow the bloom and nectar flow as it moved toward Cairo. In the 1880s North American beekeepers experimented with the same idea, moving bees on barges along the Mississippi and on waterways in Florida, but their lighter, wooden hives kept falling into the water. Other keepers tried the railroad and horsedrawn wagons, but that didn’t prove practical. Not until the 1920s when cars and trucks became affordable and roads improved, did migratory beekeeping begin to catch on. For the Californian beekeeper, the pollination season begins in February. At this time, the beehives are in particular demand by farmers who have almond groves; they need two hives an acre. For the three-week long bloom, beekeepers can hire out their hives for $32 each. It’s a bonanza for the bees too. Most people consider almond honey too bitter to eat so the bees get to keep it for themselves. By early March it is time to move the bees. It can take up to seven nights to pack the 4,000 or so hives that a beekeeper may own. These are not moved in the middle of the day because too many of the bees would end up homeless. But at night, the hives are stacked onto wooden pallets, back-to-back in sets of four, and lifted onto a truck. It is not necessary to wear gloves or a beekeeper’s veil because the hives are not being opened and the bees should remain relatively quiet. Just in case some are still lively, bees can be pacified with a few puffs of smoke blown into each hive’s narrow entrance. In their new location, the beekeeper will pay the farmer to allow his bees to feed in such places as orange groves. The honey produced here is fragrant and sweet and can be sold by the beekeepers. To encourage the bees to
produce as much honey as possible during this period, the beekeepers open the hives and stack extra boxes called supers on top. These temporary hive extensions contain frames of empty comb for the bees to fill with honey. In the brood chamber below, the bees will stash honey to eat later. To prevent the queen from crawling up to the top and laying eggs, a screen can be inserted between the brood chamber and the supers. Three weeks later the honey can be gathered. Foul smelling chemicals are often used to irritate the bees and drive them down into the hive’s bottom boxes, leaving the honeyfilled supers more or less bee free. These can then be pulled off the hive. They are heavy with honey and may weigh up to 90 pounds each. The supers are taken to a warehouse. In the extracting room, the frames are lilted out and lowered into an “uncapper” where rotating blades shave away the wax that covers each cell. The uncapped frames are put in a carousel that sits on the bottom of a large stainless steel drum. The carousel is filled to capacity with 72 frames. A switch is flipped and the frames begin to whirl at 300 revolutions per minute; centrifugal force throws the honey out of the combs. Finally the honey is poured into barrels for shipment. After this, approximately a quarter of the hives weakened by disease, mites, or an ageing or dead queen, will have to be replaced. To create new colonies, a healthy double hive, teeming with bees, can be separated into two boxes. One half will hold the queen and a young, already mated queen can be put in the other half, to make two hives from one. By the time the flowers bloom, the new queens will be laying eggs, filling each hive with young worker bees. The beekeeper’s family will then migrate with them to their summer location.

A Tourism, holidaymaking and travel are these days more significant social phenomena than most commentators have considered On the face of it there could not be a more trivial subject for a book And indeed since social scientists have had considerable difficulty explaining weightier topics such as work or politics it might be thought that they would have great difficulties in accounting for more trivial phenomena such as holidaymakmg However there are interesting parallels with the study of deviance This involves the investigation of bizarre and idiosyncratic social practices which happen to be defined as deviant in some societies but not necessarily in others The assumption is that the investigation of deviance can reveal interesting and significant aspects of normal societies It could be said that a similar analysis can be applied to tourism B Tourism is a leisure activity which presupposes its opposite namely regulated and organised work It is one manifestation of how work and leisure are organised as separate and regulated spheres of social practice in modern societies Indeed acting as a tourist is one of the defining characteristics of being modern’ and the popular concept of tourism is that it is organised within particular places and occurs for regularised periods of time Tourist relationships arise from a movement of people to and their stay in various destinations This necessarily involves some movement that is the journey and a period of stay in a new place or places The journey and the stay are by definition outside the normal places of residence and work and are of a short term and temporary nature and there is a clear intention to return “home within a relatively short period of time C  A substantial proportion of the population of modern societies engages in such tourist
practices new socialised forms of provision have developed in order to cope with the mass character of the gazes of tourists as opposed to the individual character of travel Places are chosen to be visited and be gazed upon because there is an anticipation especially through daydreaming and fantasy of intense pleasures, either on a different scale or involving different senses from those customarily encountered Such anticipation is constructed and sustained through a variety of non-tourist practices such as films TV literature, magazines records and videos which construct and reinforce this daydreaming D Tourists tend to visit features of landscape and townscape which separate them off from everyday experience Such aspects are viewed because they are taken to be in some sense out of the ordinary The viewing of these tourist sights often involves different forms of social patterning with a much greater sensitivity to visual elements of landscape or townscape than is normally found in everyday life People linger over these sights in a way that they would not normally do in their home environment and the vision is objectified or captured through photographs postcards films and so on which enable the memory to be endlessly reproduced and recaptured E One of the earliest dissertations on the subject of tourism is Boorstins analysis of the pseudo event (1964) where he argues that contemporary Americans cannot experience reality’ directly but thrive on “pseudo events Isolated from the host environment and the local people the mass tourist travels in guided groups and finds pleasure in inauthentic contrived attractions gullibly enjoying the pseudo events and disregarding the real world outside Over time the images generated of different tourist sights come to constitute a closed self-perpetuating system of illusions which provide the tourist with the basis for selecting and

evaluating potential places to visit Such visits are made says Boorstin, within the “environmental bubble of the familiar American style hotel which insulates the tourist from the strangeness of the host environment F To service the burgeoning tourist industry, an array of professionals has developed who attempt to reproduce ever-new objects for the tourist to look at These objects or places are located in a complex and changing hierarchy This depends upon the interplay between, on the one hand, competition between interests involved in
the provision of such objects and, on the other hand changing class, gender, and generational distinctions of taste within the potential population of visitors It has been said that to be a tourist is one of the characteristics of the “modern experience Not to go away is like not possessing a car or a nice house Travel is a marker of status in modern societies and is also thought to be necessary for good health The role of the professional, therefore, is to cater for the needs and tastes of the tourists in accordance with their class and overall expectations

READING PASSAGE 1
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-12 which are based on Reading Passage 2 below. SPOKEN CORPUS COMES TO LIFE A   The compiling of dictionaries has been historically the provenance of studious professorial types - usually bespectacled - who love to pore over weighty tomes and make pronouncements on the finer nuances of meaning. They were probably good at crosswords and definitely knew a lot of words, but the image was always rather dry and dusty. The latest technology, and simple technology at that, is revolutionising the content of dictionaries and the way they are put together.
B   For the first time, dictionary publishers are incorporating real, spoken English into their data. It gives lexicographers (people who write dictionaries) access to a more vibrant, up-to-date vernacular language which has never really been studied before. In one project, 150 volunteers each agreed to discreetly tie a Walkman recorder to their waist and leave it running for anything up to two weeks. Every conversation they had was recorded. When the data was collected, the length of tapes was 35 times the depth of the Atlantic Ocean. Teams of audio typists transcribed the tapes to produce a computerised database of ten million words.
C   This has been the basis - along with an existing written corpus for the Language Activator dictionary, described by lexicographer Professor Randolph Quirk as “the book the world has been waiting for”. It shows advanced foreign learners of English how the language is really used. In the dictionary, key words such as “eat” are followed by related phrases such as “wolf down” or “be a picky eater”, allowing the student to choose the appropriate phrase. D    “This kind of research would be impossible without computers,” said Delia Summers, a director of dictionaries. “It has transformed the way lexicographers work. If you look at the word “like”, you may intuitively think that the first and most frequent meaning is the verb, as in “I like swimming”. It is not. It is the preposition, as in: “she walked like a duck”. Just because a word or phrase is
61
Reading
used doesn’t mean it ends up in a dictionary. The sifting out process is as vital as ever. But the database does allow lexicographers to search for a word and find out how frequently it is used - something that could only be guessed at intuitively before.
E  Researchers have found that written English works in a very different way to spoken English. The phrase “say what you like” literally means “feel free to say anything you want”, but in reality it is used, evidence shows, by someone to prevent the other person voicing disagreement. The phrase “it”s a question of crops up on the database over and over again. It has nothing to do with enquiry, but it’s one of the most frequent English phrases which has never been in a language learner’s dictionary before: it is now.
F The Spoken Corpus computer shows how inventive and humorous people are when they are using language by twisting familiar phrases for effect. It also reveals the power of the pauses and noises we use to play for time, convey emotion, doubt and irony.
G For the moment, those benefiting most from the Spoken Corpus are foreign learners. “Computers allow lexicographers to search quickly through more examples of real English,” said Professor Geoffrey Leech of Lancaster University. “They allow dictionaries to be more accurate and give a feel for how language is being used.” The Spoken Corpus is part of the larger British National Corpus, an initiative carried out by several groups involved in the production of language learning materials: publishers, universities and the British Library.

READING PASSAGE 2
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 13-26 which are based on Reading Passage 2 below. Moles happy as homes go underground
A  The first anybody knew about Dutchman Frank Siegmund and his family was when workmen tramping through a field found a narrow steel chimney protruding through the grass. Closer inspection revealed a chink of sky-light window among the thistles, and when amazed investigators moved down the side of the hill they came across a pine door complete with leaded diamond glass and a brass knocker set into an underground building. The Siegmunds had managed to live undetected for six years outside the border town of Breda, in Holland. They are the latest in a clutch of individualistic homemakers who have burrowed underground in search of tranquillity.
B  Most, falling foul of strict building regulations, have been forced to dismantle their individualistic homes and return to more conventional lifestyles. But subterranean suburbia, Dutch-style, is about to become respectable and chic. Seven luxury homes cosseted away inside a high earth-covered noise embankment next to the main Tilburg city road recently went on the market for $296,500 each. The foundations had yet to be dug, but customers queued up to buy the unusual part-submerged houses, whose back wall consists of a grassy mound and whose front is a long glass gallery.
C  The Dutch are not the only would-be
moles. Growing numbers of Europeans are burrowing below ground to create houses, offices, discos and shopping malls. It is already proving a way of life in extreme climates; in winter months in Montreal, Canada, for instance, citizens can escape the cold in an underground complex complete with shops and even health clinics. In Tokyo builders are planning a massive underground city to be begun in the next decade, and underground shopping malls are already common in Japan, where 90 percent of the population is squeezed into 20 percent of the landspace.
D   Building big commercial buildings underground can be a way to avoid disfiguring or threatening a beautiful or “environmentally sensitive” landscape. Indeed many of the buildings which consume most land -such as cinemas, supermarkets, theatres, warehouses or libraries -have no need to be on the surface since they do not need windows.
E   There are big advantages, too, when it comes to private homes. A development of 194 houses which would take up 14 hectares of land above ground would occupy 2.7 hectares below it, while the number of roads would be halved. Under several metres of earth, noise is minimal and insulation is excellent. “We get 40 to 50 enquiries a week,” says Peter Carpenter, secretary of the British Earth Sheltering Association, which builds
65
Reading
similar homes in Britain. "People see this as a way of building for the future." An underground dweller himself, Carpenter has never paid a heating bill, thanks to solar panels and natural insulation.
F   In Europe the obstacle has been conservative local authorities and developers who prefer to ensure quick sales with conventional mass produced housing. But the Dutch development was greeted with undisguised relief by South Limburg planners because of Holland's chronic shortage of land. It was the Tilburg architect Jo Hurkmans who hit on the idea of making use of noise embankments on main roads. His twofloored, four-bedroomed, twobathroomed detached homes are now taking shape. "They are not so much below the earth as in it," he says. "All the light will come through the glass front, which runs from the second floor ceiling to the ground. Areas which do not need much natural lighting are at the back. The living accommodation is to the front so nobody notices that the back is dark."
G  In the US, where energy-efficient homes became popular after the oil crisis of 1973, 10,000 underground houses have been built. A terrace of five homes, Britain's first subterranean development, is under way in Nottinghamshire. Italy's outstanding example of subterranean architecture is the Olivetti residential centre in Ivrea. Commissioned by
Roberto Olivetti in 1969, it comprises 82 one-bedroomed apartments and 12 maisonettes and forms a house/ hotel for Olivetti employees. It is built into a hill and little can be seen from outside except a glass facade. Patnzia Vallecchi, a resident since 1992, says it is little different from living in a conventional apartment.
H  Not everyone adapts so well, and in Japan scientists at the Shimizu Corporation have developed "space creation" systems which mix light, sounds, breezes and scents to stimulate people who spend long periods below ground. Underground offices in Japan are being equipped with "virtual" windows and mirrors, while underground departments in the University of Minnesota have periscopes to reflect views and light.
I   But Frank Siegmund and his family love their hobbit lifestyle. Their home evolved when he dug a cool room for his bakery business in a hill he had created. During a heatwave they took to sleeping there. "We felt at peace and so close to nature," he says. "Gradually I began adding to the rooms. It sounds strange but we are so close to the earth we draw strength from its vibrations. Our children love it; not every child can boast of being watched through their playroom windows by rabbits.

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-38 which are based on Reading Passage 3 below. A Workaholic Economy increased production has been almost entirel} decoupled from employment. Some firms are even downsizing as their profits climb. “All things being equal, we”d be better off spreading around the work,’ observes labour economist Ronald G. Ehrenberg of Cornell University. Yet a host of factors pushes employers to hire fewer workers for more hours and, at the same time, compels workers to spend more time on the job. Most of those incentives involve what Ehrenberg calls the structure of compensation: quirks in the way salaries and benefits are organised that make it more profitable to ask 40 employees to labour an extra hour each than to hire one more worker to do the same 40-hour job. Professional and managerial employees supply the most obvious lesson along these lines. Once people are on salary, their cost to a firm is the same whether they spend 35 hours a week in the office or 70. Diminishing returns may eventually set in as overworked employees lose efficiency or leave for more arable pastures. But in the short run, the employer’s incentive is clear.
Even hourly employees receive benefits such as pension contributions and medical insurance - that are not tied to the number of hours they work. Therefore, it is more
FOR THE first century or so of the industrial    revolution,    increased productivity led to decreases in working hours. Employees who had been putting in 12-hour days, six days a week, found their time on the job shrinking to 10 hours daily, then, finally, to eight hours, five days a week. Only a generation ago social planners worried about what people would do with all this new-found free time. In the US, at least, it seems they need not have bothered. Although the output per hour of work has more than doubled since 1945, leisure seems reserved largely for the unemployed and underemployed. Those who work full-time spend as much time on the job as they did at the end of World War II. In fact, working hours have increased noticeably since 1970 — perhaps because real wages have stagnated since that year. Bookstores now abound with manuals describing how to manage time and cope with stress. There are several reasons for lost leisure. Since 1979, companies have responded to improvements in the business climate by having employees work overtime rather than by hiring extra personnel, says economist Juliet B. Schor of Harvard University. Indeed, the current economic recovery has gained a certain amount of notoriety for its “jobless” nature:

Writing
profitable for employers to work their existing employees harder. For all that employees complain about long hours, they, too, have reasons not to trade money for leisure. “People who work reduced hours pay a huge penalty in career terms,” Schor maintains. “It”s taken as a negative signal’ about their commitment to the firm.’  [Lotte] Bailyn [of Massachusetts Institute of Technology] adds that many corporate managers find it difficult to measure the contribution of their underlings to a firm’s well-being, so they use the number of hours worked as a proxy for output. “Employees know this,” she says, and they adjust their behavior accordingly. “Although the image of the good worker is the one whose life belongs to the company,” Bailyn says, “it doesn”t fit the facts.’ She cites both quantitative and qualitative studies that show increased productivity for part-time workers: they make better use of the time they have, and they are less likely to succumb to fatigue in stressful jobs. Companies that employ more workers for less time also gain from the resulting redundancy, she asserts. “The extra people can cover the contingencies that you know are going to happen, such as when
crises take people away from the workplace.’ Positive experiences with reduced hours have begun to change the more-is-better culture at some companies, Schor reports. Larger firms, in particular, appear to be more willing to experiment with flexible working arrangements... It may take even more than changes in the financial and cultural structures of employment for workers successfully to trade increased productivity and money for leisure time, Schor contends. She says the U.S. market for goods has become skewed by the assumption of full-time, two-career  households. Automobile makers no longer manufacture cheap models, and developers do not build the tiny bungalows that served the first postwar generation of home buyers. Not even the humblest household object is made without a microprocessor. As Schor notes, the situation is a curious inversion of the “appropriate technology” vision that designers have had for developing countries: U.S. goods are appropriate only for high incomes and long hours.

Practice Test 4
GLASS CAPTURING THE DANCE OF LIGHT
A  Glass, in one form or another, has long been in noble service to humans As one of the most widely used of manufactured materials, and certainly the most versatile, it can be as imposing as a telescope mirror the width of a tennis court or as small and simple as a marble rolling across dirt The uses of this adaptable material have been broadened dramatically by new technologies glass fibre optics — more than eight million miles — carrying telephone and television signals across nations, glass ceramics serving as the nose cones of missiles and as crowns for teeth; tiny glass beads taking radiation doses inside the body to specific organs, even a new type of glass fashioned of nuclear waste in order to dispose of that unwanted material.
B   On the horizon are optical computers These could   store   programs   and   process information by means of light - pulses from tiny lasers - rather than electrons And the pulses would travel over glass fibres, not copper wire These machines could function hundreds of times faster than today’s electronic computers and hold vastly more information Today fibre optics are used to obtain a clearer image of smaller and smaller objects than ever before - even bacterial
81
viruses. A new generation of optical instruments is emerging that can provide detailed imaging of the inner workings of cells. It is the surge in fibre optic use and in liquid crystal displays that has set the U.S. glass industry (a 16 billion dollar business employing some 150,000 workers) to building new plants to meet demand.
C  But it is not only in technology and commerce that glass has widened its horizons. The use of glass as art, a tradition spins back at least to Roman times,   is   also   booming.   Nearly everywhere, it seems, men and women are blowing glass and creating works of art. «I didn’t sell a piece of glass until 1975,» Dale Chihuly said, smiling, for in the 18 years since the end of the dry spell, he has become one of the most financially successful artists of the 20th century. He now has a new commission - a glass sculpture for the headquarters building of a pizza company - for which his fee is half a million dollars.
D  But not all the glass technology that touches our lives is ultra-modern. Consider the simple light bulb; at the turn of the century most light bulbs were hand blown, and the cost of one was equivalent to half a day’s pay for the average worker. In effect, the invention of the ribbon machine by Corning in the 1920s lighted a nation. The price of a bulb plunged. Small wonder that the machine has been called one of the great mechanical achievements of all time. Yet it is very simple: a narrow ribbon of molten glass travels over a moving belt of steel in which there are holes. The glass sags through the holes and into waiting moulds. Puffs of compressed air then
shape the glass. In this way, the envelope of a light bulb is made by a single machine at the rate of 66,000 an hour, as compared with 1,200 a day produced by a team of four glassblowers.
E   The secret of the versatility of glass lies in its interior structure. Although it is rigid, and thus like a solid, the atoms are arranged in a random disordered fashion, characteristic of a liquid. In the melting process, the atoms in the raw materials are disturbed from their normal position in the molecular structure; before they can find their way back to crystalline arrangements the glass cools. This looseness in molecular structure gives the material what engineers call tremendous “formability” which allows technicians to tailor glass to whatever they need.
F   Today, scientists continue to experiment with new glass mixtures and building designers test their imaginations with applications of special types of glass. A London architect, Mike Davies, sees even more dramatic buildings using molecular chemistry. “Glass is the great building material of the future, the «dynamic skin»,’ he said. “Think of glass that has been treated to react to electric currents going through it, glass that will change from clear to opaque at the push of a button, that gives you instant curtains. Think of how the tall buildings in New York could perform a symphony of colours as the glass in them is made to change colours instantly.” Glass as instant curtains is available now, but the cost is exorbitant. As for the glass changing colours instantly, that may come true. Mike Davies’s vision may indeed be on the way to fulfilment.

READING PASSAGE 2
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-27 which are based on Reading Passage 2 below Why some women cross the finish line ahead of men
RECRUITMENT The course is tougher but women are staying the distance, reports Andrew Crisp.
A  Women who apply for jobs in middle or senior management have a higher success rate than men, according to an employment survey. But of course far fewer of them apply for these positions. The study, by recruitment consultants NB
Selection, shows that while one in six men who appear on interview shortlists get jobs, the figure rises to one in four for women.
B  The study concentrated on applications for management positions in the $45,000 to $110,000 salary range and found that women are more successful than men in both the private and public sectors Dr Elisabeth Marx from London-based NB Selection described the findings as
85
Rreading
encouraging for women, in that they send a positive message to them to apply for interesting management positions. But she added, “We should not lose sight of the fact that significantly fewer women apply for senior positions in comparison with men.”
C  Reasons for higher success rates among women are difficult to isolate. One explanation suggested is that if a woman candidate manages to get on a shortlist, then she has probably already proved herself to be an exceptional candidate. Dr Marx said that when women apply for positions they tend to be better qualified than their male counterparts but are more selective and conservative in their job search. Women tend to research thoroughly before applying for positions or attending interviews. Men, on the other hand, seem to rely on their ability to sell themselves and to convince employers that any shortcomings they have will not prevent them from doing a good job.
D  Managerial and executive progress made by women is confirmed by the annual survey of boards of directors carried out by Korn/Ferry/Carre/ Orban International. This year the survey shows a doubling of the number of women serving as non-executive directors compared with the previous year. However, progress remains painfully slow and there were still only 18 posts filled by women out of a total of 354 nonexecutive positions surveyed. Hilary Sears, a partner with Korn/Ferry, said, “Women have raised the level of grades we are employed in but we have still not broken through barriers to the top.”
E   In Europe a recent feature of corporate life in the recession has been the delayering of management structures. Sears said that this has halted progress for women in as much as de-layering has taken place either where women are working or in layers they aspire to. Sears also noted a positive trend from the recession, which has been the growing number of women who have started up on their own.
F   In business as a whole, there are a number of factors encouraging the prospect of greater equality in the workforce. Demographic trends suggest that the number of women going into employment is steadily increasing. In addition a far greater number of women are now passing through higher education, making them better qualified to move into management positions.
G  Organisations such as the European Women’s Management Development Network  provide  a  range  of opportunities for women to enhance their skills and contacts. Through a series of both pan-European and national workshops and conferences the barriers to women in employment are being broken down. However, Ariane Berthoin Antal, director of the International Institute     for Organisational Change of Archamps in France, said that there is only anecdotal evidence of changes in recruitment patterns. And she said, “It”s still so hard for women to even get on to shortlists -there are so many hurdles and barriers.’ Antal agreed that there have been some positive signs but said “Until there is a belief among employers, until they value the difference, nothing will change.”

READING PASSAGE 3
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 28-39 which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.
Population viability analysis
Part A
To make political decisions about the extent and type of forestry in a region it is important to understand the consequences of those decisions. One tool for assessing the impact of forestry on the ecosystem is population viability analysis (PVA). This is a tool for predicting the probability that a species will become extinct in a particular region over a specific period. It has been successfully used in the United States to provide input into resource exploitation decisions and assist wildlife managers and there is now enormous potential for using population viability to assist wildlife management in Australia’s forests.
A species becomes extinct when the last individual dies. This observation is a useful starting point for any discussion of extinction as it highlights the role of luck and chance in the extinction process. To make a prediction about extinction we need to understand the processes that can contribute to it and these fall into four broad categories which are discussed below. Part B
A  Early attempts to predict population viability were based on demographic uncertainty Whether an individual survives from one year to the next will largely be a matter of chance. Some pairs may produce several young in a single year while others may produce none in that same year. Small populations will fluctuate enormously because of the random nature of birth and death and these chance fluctuations can cause species extinctions even if, on average, the population size should increase. Taking only this uncertainty of ability to reproduce into account, extinction is unlikely if the number of individuals in a population is above about 50 and the population is growing. B Small populations cannot avoid a certain amount of inbreeding. This is particularly true if there is a very small number of one sex. For example, if there are only 20 individuals of a species and only one is a male, all future individuals in the species must be descended from that one male. For most animal species such individuals are less likely to survive and reproduce. Inbreeding increases the chance of extinction.
88
Practice Test 4
C   Variation within a species is the raw material upon which natural selection acts. Without genetic variability a species lacks the capacity to evolve and cannot adapt to changes in its environment or to new predators and new diseases. The loss of genetic diversity associated with reductions in population size will contribute to the likelihood of extinction.
D  Recent research has shown that other factors need to be considered. Australia’s environment fluctuates enormously from year to year. These fluctuations add yet another degree of uncertainty to the survival of many species. Catastrophes such as fire, flood, drought or epidemic may reduce population sizes to a small fraction of their average level. When allowance is made for these two additional elements of uncertainty the population size necessary to be confident of persistence for a few hundred years may increase to several thousand.
Part C
Beside these processes we need to bear in mind the distribution of a population. A species that occurs in five isolated places each containing 20 individuals will not have the same probability of extinction as a species with a single population of 100 individuals in a single locality.
Where logging occurs (that is, the cutting down of forests for timber) forestdependent creatures in that area will be forced to leave. Ground-dwelling herbivores may return within a decade. However, arboreal marsupials (that is animals which live in trees) may not recover to pre-logging densities for over a century. As more forests are logged, animal population sizes will be reduced further. Regardless of the theory or model that we choose, a reduction in population size decreases the genetic diversity of a population and increases the probability of extinction because of any or all of the processes listed above. It is therefore a scientific fact that increasing the area that is loaded in any region will increase the probability that forest-dependent animals will become extinct.

You are advised to spend 20 minutes on Questions 1-14. First, read the text below and answer Questions 1-8. YOUR MOULEX IRON
A   Filling the reservoir Your iron is designed to function using tap water. However, it will last longer if you use distilled water. - Always unplug the iron before filling   the reservoir. - Always empty the reservoir after use.
B   Temperature and steam control Your Moulex iron has two buttons which control the intensity of heat produced by the iron. You can, therefore, adjust the temperature of the iron and the amount of steam being given off depending upon the type of fabric being ironed. - Turn the steam control to the desired intensity. - Turn the thermostat control to the desired temperature. Important: If your iron produces droplets of water instead of giving off steam, your temperature control is set too low.
C   Spray button This button activates a jet of cold water which allows you to iron out any unintentional creases. Press the button for one second.
D   Pressing button This button activates a super shot of steam which momentarily gives you an additional 40g of steam when needed. Important: Do not use this more than five successive times.
E   Suits etc. It is possible to use this iron in a vertical position so that you can remove creases from clothes on coathangers or from curtains. Turning the thermostat control and the steam button to maximum, hold the iron in a vertical position close to the fabric but without touching it. Hold down the pressing button for a maximum of one second. The steam produced is not always visible but is still able to remove creases. Important: Hold the iron at a sufficient distance from silk and wool to avoid all risk of scorching Do not attempt to remove creases from an item of clothing that is being worn, always use a coathanger.
F   Auto-clean In order that your iron does not become furred up, Moulex have integrated an auto-clean system and we advise you to use it very regularly (1-2 times per month). - Turn the steam control to the off position. - Fill the reservoir and turn the thermostat control to maximum. - As soon as the indicator light goes out, unplug the iron and, holding it over the sink, turn the steam control to auto-clean. Any calcium deposits will be washed out by the steam. Continue the procedure until the reservoir is empty.

READING PASSAGE 3
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 30-41 which are based on the Reading Passage below.
PAPER RECYCLING A Paper is different from other waste produce because it comes from a sustainable resource: trees. Unlike the minerals and oil used to make plastics and metals, trees are replaceable. Paper is also biodegradable, so it does not pose as much threat to the environment when it is discarded. While 45 out of every 100 tonnes of wood fibre used to make paper in Australia comes from waste paper, the rest comes directly from virgin fibre from forests and plantations. By world standards this is a good performance since the world-wide average is 33 per cent waste paper. Governments have encouraged waste paper collection and sorting schemes and at the same time, the paper industry has responded by developing new recycling technologies that have paved the way for even greater utilisation of used fibre. As a result, industry’s use of recycled fibres is expected to increase at twice the rate of virgin fibre over the coming years. B  Already, waste paper constitutes 70% of paper used for packaging and advances in the technology required to remove ink from the paper have allowed a higher recycled content in newsprint and writing paper. To achieve the benefits of     recycling, the community must also contribute. We need to accept a change in the quality of paper products; for example stationery may be less white and of a rougher texture. There also needs to be support from the community for waste paper collection programs. Not only do we need to make the paper available to collectors but it also needs to be separated into different types and sorted from contaminants such as staples, paperclips, string and other miscellaneous items. C There are technical limitations to the amount of paper which can be recycled and some paper products cannot be collected for re-use. These include paper in the form of books and permanent records, photographic paper and paper which is badly contaminated. The four most common sources of paper for recycling are factories and retail stores which gather large amounts of packaging material in which goods are delivered, also offices which have unwanted business documents and computer output, paper converters and printers and lastly households which discard newspapers and packaging material. The paper manufacturer pays a price for the paper and may also incur the collection cost.
103
D Once collected, the paper has to be sorted by hand by people trained to recognise various types of paper. This is necessary because some types of paper can only be made from particular kinds of recycled fibre. The sorted paper then has to be repulped or mixed with water and broken down into its individual fibres. This mixture is called stock and may contain a wide variety of contaminating materials, particularly if it is made from mixed waste paper which has had little sorting. Various machinery is used to remove other materials from the stock. After passing through the repulping process, the fibres from printed waste paper are grey in colour because the printing ink has soaked into the individual fibres. This recycled material can only be used in products where the grey colour does not matter, such as cardboard boxes but if the grey colour is not acceptable, the fibres must be de-inked. This involves adding chemicals such as caustic soda or other alkalis, soaps and detergents, water-hardening agents such as calcium chloride, frothing agents and
bleaching agents. Before the recycled fibres can be made into paper they must be refined or treated in such a way that they bond together. E   Most paper products must contain some virgin fibre as well as recycled fibres and unlike glass, paper cannot be recycled indefinitely. Most paper is down-cycled which means that a product made from recycled paper is of an inferior quality to the original paper. Recycling paper is beneficial in that it saves some of the energy, labour and capital that goes into producing virgin pulp. However, recycling requires the use of fossil fuel, a non-renewable energy source, to collect the waste paper from the community and to process it to produce new paper. And the recycling process still creates emissions which require treatment before they can be disposed of safely. Nevertheless, paper recycling is an important economical and environmental practice but one which must be carried out in a rational and viable manner for it to be useful to both industry and the community.

The Prime Minister has promised to help the drought stricken farmers in the Example northern part of the country who haven’t seen rain for nearly two years. And in Sydney a group of school children are successfully rescued from a plane which Q11 landed in the sea shortly after take-off. Transport workers are on strike in Melbourne over a pay claim and the strike looks set to spread to other states. And Q12 on a fashionable note, there s to be a new look for the staff of QANTAS, Q13 Australia’s national airline.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Prime Minister has pledged today that he will make two hundred and fifty Q14 million dollars available to help the drought stricken farmers who have not seen ram for years, get through the next five years. Money that was to have been spent on the re-structuring of Sydney’s road system has been re-allocated to what the Q15 P:rime Minister described as 'a more worthy cause'. Farmers are to receive financial assistance to help see them through the worst drought in over 50 years. Many farmers feel that while the money is welcome it has come too late to save Q16

them and their farms from financial ruin and are angry that the government did not act sooner.
A group of school children who were travelling in a privately chartered Q17 aeroplane from Sydney to Queensland to take part in a musical concert found themselves swimming for the shore when their aeroplane had to land in the sea just three minutes after taking off from Sydney airport. The pilot managed to Q18 bring the aircraft and its 50 passengers down safely in the calm waters of Botany Bay where boats and pleasurecraft were able to come to the rescue of the boys. Q19 The fact that it was a weekend meant that there were hundreds of boats in the bay enjoying the good weather and this undoubtedly helped the rescue operation. 'We owe our lives to the skill of the pilot,' said one of the boys, but the Q20 pilot replied modestly that it was 'all part of a day’s work'. However, all their Q21 musical instruments were lost and they never got to play at their concert.

SECTION 4
Lecturer: Good morning and welcome to the University of Westlands. My name is Marcia Mayhew and I’m the co-ordmator of the Bachelor of Social Science degree. This morning I’d like to tell you about the structure of the university and about some of the requirements of the degree that you’re about to enter. The Bachelor of Social Science is in one faculty within the university, that is the faculty where I Q32 work, known as Arts and Social Sciences. Here on this campus we also have the faculties of Architecture, Law and Science and Technology among others. It’s important to know something about the structure of the faculty because, as you go through your course, you may need to call on members of the staff to help you. At the top of the faculty we have a dean and below the dean we have three Q33 divisions; each division has a divisional head and your degree is located in the Division of Social Sciences. Within each of the divisions, there are the departments and each of these offers the different degrees. For instance two of the departments which offer the major subjects for your award are Sociology and Psychology. Each has a departmental head but for practical purposes the people you are going to see the most of are myself as co-ordinator of the social sciences degree and the actual lecturers who are teaching the subjects that you are taking. For instance in the first semester you’ll be doing four subjects psychology sociology history and Q34 economics. If you have any problems or difficulties, not that I’m anticipating you will, but you never know, then you should go and see your lecturers. For instance, you may find that you can’t meet a deadline for an essay or perhaps you re having Q35 problems with attendance. These seem to be the two most common problems that Q36 students face.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your lecturers are unavailable, you can always come and see me in my office. I’m available on Wednesday and Thursday mornings and on Friday afternoons Q37 Outside these hours, perhaps you could ring the secretary and make an appointment. Now you’ll note that all of the subjects which you undertake in the first year are composed of lectures and tutorials. A lecture is about an hour long and a tutorial usually runs for about two hours. A lecture is rather like what I am doing now where one person will talk to all of you together on a subject. We do ask you to try to attend the lectures.
A tutorial is perhaps where most of the learning occurs at a university. You will be divided into groups of between 12 and 15 students and each week one of you will have to present a piece of work to the group as a whole and then the group will discuss what you’ve said. It’s this discussion, this exchange of ideas, which Q38 really constitutes the basis of university learning, in my view. Listening to lectures in many ways is just giving you information that you could access for yourself in
112
Practice Test 2
PRACTICE TEST 2
the library but the discussion at the tutorial is very important. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go to the lectures though!
Other factors to be particularly concerned about are the structure of essays and delivery of written material and in particular I would like to mention the question of plagiarism. Plagiarism is taking other people’s work without acknowledging it, that is, without saying where it comes from. Of course all essays are based on research done by other people but you must remember to attribute the work to the Q39 original writer. And while it’s a good idea to work with other people don’t hand in work which is exactly the same as your friend’s work because we will notice! If you don’t acknowledge the source of your information then you run the risk of Q40 failing the subject or in very serious cases you might be denied entry to the university.
Last but not least, stay in touch with us. If things are getting you down, don’t Q41 tests go and hide. Come and talk to us about it. That’s what we are here for. Right, global thank you very much for coming along today. understanding of the talk

C: Well, as I explained on the phone, Im a Counsellor here at the Student Services section of the university and Im interviewing overseas students to help me draw up a guide for new students so Id be grateful if you could tell me a little about your time since youve been here in Cambridge. K: Right. L: Good idea. C: Now, Kate lets start with you. OK, um   this is your second semester isnt It? Could you tell us something about your first impressions of the town when you arrived? K: Yeah well first of all I was struck by how quiet it is here in the evening Example Repeat C: Yes, I suppose Cambridge is a quiet place. Where did you live when you first arrived? K: Well, I went straight into student accommodation; it was a kind of student Q1 hostel. C: Ah right, so you didnt have to worry about doing your own cooking or anything like that?

K: No, but sometimes I wished I had! The food at the hostel was awful. Q2 C: Oh dear. But how were the other students? K: To be honest I haven’t managed to make many friends even though the place is full. People seem to keep to themselves; they’re not really very friendly. Q3 C: Oh I’m sorry to hear that. Well, what about the actual course? You’re studying … uh? K: I’m doing a Masters by coursework in Environmental Studies. C: Ah, right, and how are you finding that? K: Yeah, well, it’s been pretty good really. I’ve enjoyed the course, but I feel there hasn’t been enough contact with the lecturers. They all seem to be Q4 incredibly busy. The only chance I’ve really had to talk to them was on the field trip. C: Well that’s no good. Could anything be done to improve the course in your opinion? K: Well … I think it would be helpful to have meetings with lecturers on the Q5 course. Say once a fortnight — something like that. C: Regular meetings. Yes that could certainly help. Now Kate, we’ll come back. to you in a minute, but I’d just like to ask Luki some questions.

C: Luki, Where are you from? L: I am from Indonesia. C: And how did you find Cambridge when you first arrived? L: Well, I like it here. I think the city is very beautiful. C: What about your accommodation? Was that OK? L: Yes, OK. At first I stayed with a family for three months. They were very Q6 kind to me but they had three young children and I found it difficult to Q7 study C: Right, I see. L: So after three months I moved out and now I live with two other students in a student house. It’s much cheaper and we like it there. Q8 C: Good, and what about your studies? What are you studying? L: I’m doing a Bachelor of Computing. Q9 C: Computing. I see. Um, apart from the language difficulties, if you can separate them, how have you found the course? L: OK, but … C: Yes, go on. L: Well, the main difficulty for me is getting time on the computers in the computer room. It’s always busy and this makes it very hard to do my practical work. C: Yes, I’m sure it would. Can you reserve time in the computer room? L: No, you can’t … but it would certainly help if we could reserve computer time. Q10 C: Yes. I’ll look into that and see if something can’t be done to improve things over there. Now let’s go back to Kate...

Radio presenter:
Well, last week we talked about buying camping equipment and today I’d like to talk to you about buying a bicycle. A simple enough exercise, you might imagine, but there are lots of things to look out for to make sure you get the best deal for your money. Well, the range of bicycles is enormous — there are racing bikes, touring bikes, mountain bikes or just plain ordinary bikes for riding round town. They vary Q11 enormously in two basic ways: price and quality. This means that the choice you Q12 make will probably be determined by the amount of money you want to pay, your own personal needs, what is actually available or a compromise of all three things. However, in broad terms you can spend anything from $50 to $2,000 on a bike so, Q13 you’ll need to know what you are looking for. Single speed cycles — that is bikes with no gears, are really only suited to short, casual rides. Their attraction is their simplicity and reliability. After years of Q14 neglect they still manage to function, though not always too efficiently. If it’s basic transport you’re after then you can’t go wrong. Three speed cycles on the other hand are all that is really necessary for most town riding, going to the shops and things like that. Like the single speed bike Q15 they are simple and reliable. If you are going to be going up and down lots of hills, then you’ll probably want something more efficient. Five and ten speed bicycles are best suited to riding over long distances or hilly terrain and to serious touring, so if it’s serious touring you’re interested in, get a five Q16 or ten speed bike. However it’s worth remembering that the difference in price between a five and ten speed cycle is usually very little and so it’s well worth Q17 paying that little bit extra to get the ten speed one. So I would tend to recommend the ten speed bike as the price is similar — however you’ll be getting better quality components. Q18 Now the next thing we need to look at is size. Buying a cycle is like buying clothes, first of all you find the right size and then you try it on to see if it fits. Q19 Contrary to what you might imagine, the size of the cycle is not determined by the size of the wheels (except in children’s cycles), but by the size of the frame. So Q20 you’ll need to measure the length of your legs and arms to get a frame that is the right size for you. Well, that’s all from Helpful Hints for today …

M: Well  after some consideration I decided to look at the history of banana growing in Australia. F: (surprised) Banana growing! M: Yes, banana growing. F: (sarcastically) Fascinating, Im sure! Q21 M: Well  its not as boring as youd think. And I wanted to tie it in to the work Ive been doing on primary industries and the economy. Anyway I bet there are a few things you didnt know about bananas! F: Such as? M: Such as the fact that bananas were among the first plants ever to be domesticated. F: Oh, really? M: Yes, theyre an extremely nourishing food. Q22 F: I suppose youre going to tell me the whole history of banana growing now arent you? M: Well, itd be a good practice run for my tutorial next week. Ill do the same Q23 for you some time. F: OK. Fire away. So where were these bananas first domesticated? M: According to my research, the Cavendish banana, which is a type of banana and the first type to be cultivated here, actually originated in China but they had a fairly roundabout route before they got to Australia. F: You mean they didnt go straight from China to Australia? M: No, they didnt. It seems that in 1826, bananas were taken from South China to England. F: I suppose they would have made a welcome addition to the English diet. M: Yes, Im sure. Well apparently there was an English Duke who was particularly fond of bananas and he used to cultivate them in his hothouse, which is where you have to grow them in England, of course, because of the cool climate and they became quite popular in the UK. So he was the one Q24 responsible for cultivating the Cavendish banana which was then introduced into Australia. F: I see. And weve been growing them ever since? M: Yes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------F: Are they hard to grow? M: Well, yes and no. To grow them in your garden, no, not really. But to grow them commercially you need to know what you’re doing. You see you only get one bunch of bananas per tree and it can take up to three years for a tree Q25 to bear fruit if you don’t do anything special to it. But this period is greatly reduced with modern growing methods, particularly in plantations where you have perfect tropical conditions. F: Right! So what are you looking at? One year? Two years? M: No, no, around 15 months in good conditions for a tree to produce a bunch of Q26 bananas. And once youve got your bunch you cut the bunch and the plant down. F: So how do the trees reproduce then? M: Well, bananas are normally grown from suckers which spring up around the parent plant, usually just above the plant. They tend to like to grow uphill  Q27 or at least thats the common wisdom.
116
Practice Test 2
F: So that’s why banana plantations are usually on hillsides, is it? M: Yes. They grow best like that. F: That’s interesting! M: If you plant them in rich soil and give them plenty of water at the beginning Q28 of summer, then they should be well advanced by the beginning of winter when growth virtually stops. But in a country like England, theyre hard to grow, although you can grow them in a hothouse. F: But in Australia, its not difficult? M: No, though even here, the growers put plastic bags around the bunches to Q29 protect them and keep them warm. If you go up to the banana growing districts, youll see all these banana trees with plastic bags on them. F: But how do they stop the bananas going bad before they reach the shops? M: Well, the banana bunches are picked well before the fruit is ripe. Once you cut the bunch, the bananas stop growing but they do continue to ripen. The interesting thing is that once one banana ripens, it gives off a gas which then helps all the others to ripen so they pretty much all ripen within a few hours Q30 of each other. F: Amazing! So do we export lots of bananas overseas, to Europe and Asia for instance? M: Well, oddly enough, no. I believe New Zealand takes a small proportion of Q31 or 32 the crop but otherwise theyre mostly grown for the domestic market, which Q32 or 31 is surprising when you think about it because we grow an enormous number of bananas each year. F: Yes, well thank you for all that information. Im sure the tutorial paper will go really well you certainly seem to have done your research on the subject. M: Lets hope so.

J = John D = Diane Greenbaum
J: Good morning, good morning, everyone, and welcome to our regular lecture on health issues. This series of lectures is organised by the Students’ Union and is part of the union’s attempt to help you, the students of this university, to stay healthy while coping with study and social life at the same time. So Q33 it’s a great pleasure for me to welcome back Ms Diane Greenbaum who is a professional dietician and who has been kind enough to give up her time, in Q34 what I know is a very hectic schedule, to come along and talk to us today. D: Thank you. Thank you very much, John. May I say it’s a pleasure to be back. Now, stresses at university, being away from home and having to look after yourselves, learning your way around the campus all contribute to making it quite hard sometimes to ensure that your diet is adequate. So today I’m going to talk about ways of making sure that you eat well while at the same time staying within your budget. Q35
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a well balanced diet, then you should be getting all the vitamins
117
Tapescripts
that you need for normal daily living. However sometimes we think we’re eating the right foods but the vitamins are escaping, perhaps as a result of cooking and anyway we’re not getting the full benefit of them. Now, if you Q36 lack vitamins in any way the solution isn’t to rush off and take vitamin pills. though they can sometimes help. No it’s far better to look at your diet and how you prepare your food. So what are vitamins? Well, the dictionary tells us they are food factors essential in small quantities to maintain life. Now, there are fat soluble vitamins which can be stored for quite some time by the body and there are water soluble vitamins which are removed more rapidly from the body and so a regular daily intake of these ones is needed. Q37 OK, so how can you ensure that your diet contains enough of the vitamins you need? Well, first of all, you may have to establish some new eating habits! No more chips at the uni canteen, Im afraid! Now firstly, you must eat a variety of foods. Then you need to ensure that you eat at least four Q38 servings of fruit and vegetables daily. Now youll need to shop two or three times a week to make sure that theyre fresh, and store your vegetables in the fridge or in a cool dark place. Q39 Now let s just refresh our memories by looking at the Healthy Diet Pyramid. OK, can you all see that? Good. Well ,now, as you see weve got three levels to our pyramid. At the top in the smallest area are the things which we should really be trying to avoid as much as possible. Things like  Example yes, sugar, salt, butter  all that sort of thing. Next, on the middle of our pyramid we find the things that we can eat in moderation. Not too much though! And thats where we find milk, lean meat, Q40 fish, nuts, eggs. And then at the bottom of the pyramid are the things that you can eat lots of! Because theyre the things that are really good for you Q41 And here we have bread, vegetables and fruit. So dont lose sight of your healthy diet pyramid when you do your shopping.

M: How do you come to the university each day? Train or bus or do you have a car? F: Oh, I always walk — I haven’t got a car and anyway I live quite close. Example Repeat M: Do you know anything about parking rights on the campus? I was wondering whether students are allowed to park their cars on the campus or not?

F: Yes, I think it’s possible for post graduate students but not for Q1 undergraduate students. M: That doesn’t seem very fair. F: No, I suppose not, but there simply isn’t enough room on the campus for everyone to park. M: Do you need a parking permit? F: Yeah, I believe you do. M: Where do I get that from? F: I think you can get a parking sticker from the administration office. M: Where’s that? F: It’s in the building called Block G. Right next to Block E. Q2 M: Block G? F: Yeah. M: Oh right. And what happens to you if you don’t buy a sticker? Do they clamp your wheels or give you a fine? F: No, I think they tow your car away. Q3 M: Oh really? F: Yeah. And then they fine you as well because you have to pay to get the car Q3 back. M: I’d better get the sticker then. F: Yeah. M: Where exactly is the administration office again? I’m new to this university and I’m still trying to find my way around. F: Right. You go along Library Road, past the tennis courts on your left and the swimming pool on your right and the administration office is opposite the car park on the left. You can’t miss it. M: So it’s up Library Road, past the swimming pool, opposite the car park. Q4 Right, I’ll go straight over there. Bye and thanks for the help.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C: Good morning, can I help you? M: Yes, I was told to come over here to get a parking sticker. Is this the right place? C: Yes, it is. Are you a post graduate student? M: Yes, I am. C: OK, well, I’ll just need to take some details ... Your name? M: Richard Lee — that’s spelt L double E. Q5 C: Richard ... Lee. And the address? M: Flat 13, 30 Enmore Road Q6 C: How do you spell Enmore? M: E-N-M-0-R-E. And that’s in the suburb of Newport: N-E-W-P-0-R-T. Q7 C: Faculty? M: I beg your pardon? C: Which faculty are you in? M: Architecture, the Faculty of Architecture. Q8 C: Right ... and the registration number of your car? M: Let me see um L X J five oh ... No, sorry, I always get that wrong, it’s LJX 058K. Q9 C: LJX 508K.
119
M: No … 058K C: Ah. And what make is the car? M: It s a Ford Q10 C: A Ford. Fine! Well, I’ll just get you to sign here and when you’ve paid the cashier I’ll be able to issue you with the sticker. M: Right. Where do I pay? C: Just across the corridor in the cashier’s office. Oh, but it’s 12.30 now and they close at 12.15 for lunch. But they open again at a quarter past two until Q11 4.30 M: Oh .. they’re not open till quarter past two? C: No. When you get your sticker, you must attach it to the front windscreen of Q12 your car. I m afraid it’s not valid if you don’t have it stuck on the window. M: Right, I see. Thanks very much I’ll just wait here then.
SECTION 2
Guide: Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Maritime Museum. Now before we commence our tour I’d just like to tell you a little bit about the history of the museum As you can see, it’s a very modern building built in the post modern style and it was in fact opened by the Prime Minister of Australia in November 1991. It’s been designed with a nautical flavour in mind to remind us of Q13 our links with the sea. But the museum isn’t only housed in this building, there are a number of historic ships docked outside in the harbour which form part of the museum and which you are also free to visit, and we’ll be coming to them shortly Q14 I’d just like to point out one or two things of general interest while we’re here. Handicapped toilets are located on this floor and the door shows a wheelchair. Example The cloakroom where you can hang your coat or leave your bags is just behind us here. The education centre is on the top floor and there’s a good little library in there which you might like to use. Follow the signs to the Education Centre — you’ll see a lot of little green arrows on the wall. The green arrows will take you Q15 there. The information desk, marked with the small letter i on your plan is located right here in the foyer, so if you get separated from your friends, I suggest you make your way back to the information desk because we’ll be returning to this Q16 spot at the end of the tour. All right? Now if you look out this window you should be able to see where the museums ships are docked. If you want to go on a tour of the old ship, the Vampire, shes docked over there and you should meet outside on the quay. However a word of warning! I dont recommend it for the grandmas and grandpas because there are lots of stairs to climb. Right, now, lets move on Q17 Oh, I almost forgot to give you the times for that tour. Now, tours of the Vampire run on the hour every hour. All right? Q18
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Let’s take a walk round the museum now. The first room we’re coming to is the theatre. This room is used to screen videos of special interest and we also use it for lectures. There’s a continuous video showing today about the voyages of Captain

Practice Test 3
Cook, so come back here later on if you want to learn more about Captain Cook. Q19 Now, we’re moving along the gallery known as the Leisure Gallery. This is one of our permanent exhibitions and here we try to give you an idea of the many different ways in which Australians have enjoyed their time by the sea: surfing, swimming, lifesavmg clubs, that’s all very much a part of Australian culture. At the Q20 end of this section we’ll come to the Picture Gallery where we’ve got a marvellous collection of paintings all by Australian artists. I think you can buy reproductions Q21 of some of these paintings in the museum shop. Well worth a good look.
Now we’re coming to the Members’ Lounge. As a member of the museum you would be entitled to use the members’ lounge for refreshments. Membership costs $50 a year or $70 for all the family. So it’s quite good value because entry to the Q22 museum is then free.
And down at the far end of this floor, you’ll find the section which we’ve called Passengers and the Sea. In this part of the museum we’ve gathered together a wonderful collection of souvenirs from the old days when people travelled by ship. Q23 You’ll find all sorts of things there: old suitcases, ships’ crockery, first class cabins decorated in the fashion of the day. Just imagine what it must have been like to travel first class.
Now I’m going to leave you to walk round the museum on your own for a while and we’ll all meet back again at the information desk in three quarters of an hour’s time. I hope you enjoy your time with us at the museum today. Thank you.
SECTION 3
T = Tutor M = Mark S = Susan
T: OK, everybody, good morning! It’s Mark’s turn to talk to us today so Mark, I’ll ask you to get straight down to business. M: Right! T: Now following on from what we were discussing last week in Susan’s tutorial on approaches to marketing, you were going to give us a quick run down on a new strategy for pricing which is now being used by many large companies Q24 known as “revenue management” … before we go on to your actual tutorial paper on Sales Targets. Is that correct? M: Yeah, OK, well … T: So what exactly is revenue management? M: Well, it’s a way of managing your pricing by treating things like airline tickets and hotel rooms rather more as if they were perishable goods. S: Yeah, I just tried to book a ticket yesterday for Perth and would you believe there are three different prices for the flight? M: Right! And what was the rationale for that? S: Well … the travel agent said it depended on when you book and the length of the stay, like it’s cheap if you stay away for a Saturday night, presumably because this isn’t business travel and even cheaper if you buy a ticket where Q25
121
Tapescripts
you can’t get a refund if you have to cancel; in that case the ticket costs about half the price. You wouldn’t think it would make that much difference, would you? M: Well it does, and that’s basically because the airlines are now treating their seats like a commodity. You see — if you want a seat today, then you pay far more for it than if you want it in three weeks’ time. S: That seems rather unfair. M: Well … not really … when you think about it, that’s just common sense isn t Q26 if? S: I suppose so. T: What this actually means is that in the same row of seats on the same flight you could have three people who have all paid a different price for their tickets. S: And is this just happening in Australia? M: No, no it’s the same all over the world. Airlines are able to “market” a seat as a perishable product, with different values at different stages of its life. S: Well like mangoes or apples at the market. M: Yeah, it’s exactly like that. The fact is that the companies are not actually interested in selling you a cheap flight! They’re interested in selling the seats Q27 and flying aeroplanes that are full. T: Mark why do you think revenue management has come about? M: Well, as far as I can see there are two basic reasons: firstly because the law has been changed to allow the companies to do this. You see in the past they Q28 didn’t have the right to keep changing the prices of the tickets, and secondly we now have very powerful computer programs to do the calculations and so Q29 the prices can be changed at a moment’s notice. S: So you mean ten minutes could be critical when you’re buying a plane ticket? M: Absolutely! T: That’s right! M: And I understand we have almost reached the stage where these computer programs that the airlines are using will eventually be available to consumers to find the best deals for their travel plans from their home computer Q30 S: Heavens! What a thought! So the travel agent could easily become a thing of the past if you could book your airline tickets from home. Are there any other industries using this system, or is it restricted to the airline business? M: Many of the big hotel groups are doing it now. That’s why the price of a bed Q31 in a hotel can also vary so much … depending on when and where you book it T: It’s all a bit of a gamble really. M: Yes, and hire car companies are also using revenue management to set their Q32 tariffs, because they are also dealing with a “commodity” if you like … so the cost of hiring a car will depend on demand. T: Well, thank you, Mark, for that overview … that was well researched. Now let’s get on with your main topic for today…

SECTION 4
Marketing Consultant: Good morning. Welcome to this talk on Space Management. And today I’m going to look particularly at space management in the supermarket. Now since the time supermarkets began, marketing consultants, like us, have been gathering information about customers’ shopping habits. To date, various research methods have been used to help promote the sales of supermarket products. There is, for example, the simple and direct questionnaire Examph which provides information from customers about their views on displays and Q33 products and then helps retailers make decisions about what to put where. Another method to help managers understand just how shoppers go around their stores are the hidden television cameras that film us as we shop and monitor Q34 our physical movement around the supermarket aisles: where do we start, what do we buy last, what attracts us, etc. More sophisticated techniques now include video surveillance and such devices as the eye movement recorder. This is a device which shoppers volunteer to wear Q35 taped into a headband, and which traces their eye movements as they walk round the shop recording the most eye-catching areas of shelves and aisles. But with today’s technology. Space Management is now a highly sophisticated method of manipulating the way we shop to ensure maximum profit. Supermarkets are able to invest millions of pounds in powerful computers which tell them what sells best and where. Now, an example of this is Spaceman which is a computer program that helps Q36 the retailer to decide which particular product sells best in which part of the store. Now Spaceman works by receiving information from the electronic checkouts (where customers pay) on how well a product is selling in a particular position. Spaceman then suggests the most profitable combination of an article and its Q37 position in the store. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, let’s have a look at what we know about supermarkets and the way people behave when they walk down the aisles and take the articles they think they need from the shelves. Now here’s a diagram of one supermarket aisle and two rows of shelves. Here’s the entrance at the top left-hand corner. Now products placed here, at the beginning of aisles, don’t sell well. In tests, secret fixed cameras have filmed shoppers’ movements around a store over a seven-day period. When the film is speeded up, it clearly shows that we walk straight past Q38 these areas on our way to the centre of an aisle. Items placed here just don’t attract people. When we finally stop at the centre of an aisle, we pause and take stock, casting our eyes along the length of it. Now products displayed here sell well and do even better if they are placed at eye level so that the customer’s eyes hit upon them Q39 instantly. Products here are snapped up and manufacturers pay a lot for these shelf areas which are known in the trade as hotspots. Naturally everyone wants Q40 their products to be in a hotspot. But the prime positions in the store are the ends of the aisles, otherwise known as Gondola ends. Now these stand out and grab our attention. For this reason new
123
Tapescripts
products are launched in these positions and manufacturers are charged widely varying prices for this privileged spot. Also, the end of an aisle may be used for promoting special offers which are frequently found waiting for us as we turn the Q41 corner of an aisle.
Well, now, eventually of course, we have to pay. Any spot where a supermarket can be sure we are going to stand still and concentrate for more than a few seconds is good for sales. That’s why the shelves at the checkout have long been a favourite for manufacturers of chocolates — perhaps the most sure-fire “impulse” Q42 food of all.
SECTION 1

F: Excuse me. Can you help me? I was looking for the Main Hall. M: Maybe I can, actually. I’m looking for the Main Hall, too. I think it’s in the Example Administration building. Are you a new student? F: Yes, I am. Repeat M: I thought you looked as lost as me. I’m trying to find the admin building, too, so that I can register for my course. But I don’t seem to be having much luck. F: Well, look, according to this map of the campus here, you go straight up the steps, turn left and the building is on the right. OK, let’s see if we can find it. Q1 M: Oh, this looks right. Oh, yeah, it must be. Look, there are hundreds of other people here! F: There must be at least 50 people in the queue — we’ll be here till gone 2 Q2 o’clock at this rate. M: And I’m starving! F: So am I. M: Actually, I was on my way to the canteen to get something for lunch. Why don’t I go to the canteen and buy something and you stay here and wait? F: Good idea. M: What would you like? Pizza, sandwich, hot dog, fried rice. They do everything ... F: Oh, something easy. Take away fried rice sounds good. M: OK, fried ... F: No, on second thoughts, I’ll have a cheese and tomato sandwich. Q3 M: Right one cheese and tomato — anything to drink? F: Yeah, get me a coffee, would you? M: Oh, hot coffee’s a bit hard to carry. What about a coke or an orange juice?

Q9 F: I beg your pardon? C: What course are you doing? F: First Year Law. Q10 C: Right. Well, you’ll have to go across to the Law Faculty and get this card stamped and then you come back here with it and pay your union fee. F: Thanks very much.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
M: Oh, there you are. F: I thought you were never going to come back. M: Sorry! The canteen was absolutely packed and I had to wait for ages. Then when I got to the front of the queue they had hardly any food left. So I had to get you a slice of pizza. I’m sorry. Q11 F: Oh, that’s OK. I could eat anything, I’m so hungry. M: And there’s your bottle of orange juice and your apple. At least I managed that. F: Great. Thanks a lot. M: Oh and here’s your $2 back. F: Don’t worry about it. Buy me a cup of coffee later! M: Oh, alright then! So how’d you go? F: Well in order to register we’ve got to go to the Law Faculty and get this card stamped and then go back to the Admin building and pay the union fees. Q12 That means we’re registered. After that we have to go to the notice board to find out about lectures and then we have to put our names down for tutorial groups and go to the library to ... M: Great. Well first let’s sit down and have our lunch.

SECTION 2
Speaker: Thanks for turning up today, thanks for turning up toddy to this short talk I’m going to give on student banking. Many of you are unfamiliar with the way banks work in this country and today’s talk should just give you a few starting points. I will of course answer any questions at the end. Right. Well ,as you probably know, you’ll need to open a bank account while you’re here — it’s the safest place to keep your money and it’s best to open an account with one of the major banks. You should each have a handout with the names and addresses … there’s Barclays in Realty Square, National Westminster in Example Preston Park,  Lloyds in City Plaza and Midland in Hope Street. OK. All these banks Q13 offer special student accounts. However, it’s important to note that as an international student you’ll not necessarily be eligible for all the facilities offered to resident students. Now, as an international student you will need to provide evidence that you can Q14 fund yourself for however long your course lasts. Banks have different policies and the services that they’ll offer you will depend on your individual circumstances and on the discretion of the bank manager involved. So it’s a matter of going there and finding out about your own particular situation. Right, erm, when you do go to open a bank account, you should take some documentation with you. I’ve already mentioned that you must be able to support yourself. In addition to this most banks ask you to bring your passport and your Q15 letter or certificate of enrolment. OK? Now, by far the most useful type of account to open is a current account. When you do this, you will actually get what is called a “student account” which is a Q16 current account with special concessions for students. When you open the account, the bank will give you a chequebook and you can use this to draw money out Q17 as you need it. If you need to write cheques in shops, you’ll also need a cheque card. This is really an identity card which guarantees that correctly written cheques up to the value stated on the card will be honoured by the bank. OK? -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right, er, if you want to draw out cash for yourself you can make the cheque payable in your own name or “to cash”. You can also withdraw cash from a cashpoint machine with a cashcard. These are extremely useful as they enable you to withdraw cash from your account during the day or at night. Q18 There is also another card called Switch or Delta and you can use this to pay for things in shops. It takes the money right out of your account, so you don’t need QI9 your chequebook. Now — you may want to take more money out of the bank than you have in it. This is called having an overdraft. Be very careful with this you should not do this without permission from your bank. Overdrafts usually incur charges though Q20 some banks offer interest-free overdrafts to some students. But find out before you get one! Right? Well, that just leaves opening times — when can you go? Banks used to be open from 9.30 am until 3.30 pm from Monday to Friday but many main branches are now open until 4.30 or 5 pm on weekdays and some of the bigger branches in Q21
126

London and other major cities are now open for a limited time on Saturdays. OK — any questions?
SECTION 3
I = Ilmar D = Dawn
I: Hi, Dawn. D: Oh hi, Ilmar. I: I’m glad I’ve bumped into you. I’ve just found a great idea for the presentation we’ve got to do for Dr Banks next month. D: What, the one on everyday objects? I: Yes ... look at this article ... it’s really interesting. D: The aluminium coke can? I: You know ... coca cola cans, soft drink cans. Look let’s sit down here. Have you got a minute? D: Sure ... I’ll just get my bag. D: OK, so you think we can get a presentation out of this article? I: I’m sure we can. First of all we can provide some interesting facts about the aluminium cans that we drink out of every day. D: Like ... ? I: Well, here ... it says that in the US they produce 300 million aluminium Q22 drink cans each day. D: Wow! 300 million! I: Exactly. That’s an enormous number. It says here “outstrips the production of nails or paper clips”. And they say that the manufacturers of these cans Q23 exercise as much attention and precision in producing them as aircraft manufacturers do when they make the wing of an aircraft! D: Really! Let’s have a look. I: They’re trying to produce the perfect can - as thin but as strong as possible. D: Mmm ... this bit’s interesting ... “today”s can weighs about 0.48 ounces: thinner than two pieces of paper ... from this magazine say.’ Q24 I: Yeah, and yet it can take a lot of weight. D: More than 90 pounds of pressure per square inch — three times the pressure of a car tyre. OK, I agree, it’s a good topic. Q25
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I: What I thought was that we could do a large picture of a coke can and label it and then talk about the different parts. Look, I’ve done a rough picture here. D: OK, so where shall we start? I: Well, the lid is complicated. Let’s start with the body first. I’ll do a line from the centre of the can ... like this ... and label it “body “. What does it say? D: It”s made of aluminium, of course, and it’s thicker at the bottom. Q26 I: Right, so that it can take all that pressure.
127
Tapescripts
D: And then I think you should draw another line from the body for the label. I: Right “label”. The aluminium is ironed out until it’s so thin that it produces Q27 what does it say? D: “A reflective surface suitable for decoration.” I: That’s right apparently it helps advertisers, too. D: Yes, because it’s so attractively decorated. I: Good … and then there’s the base. D: Yes, it says the bottom of the can is shaped like a dome so that it can resist Q28 the internal pressure. I: That’s interesting. I didn’t know that. D: Nor did I. OK, so going up to the lid … there are several things we can label here. There’s the rim around the edge which seals the can. I: Got that. And there’s a funny word for the seal isn’t there? D: Yes, it’s a flange Q29 I: What does it say about it? D: Well, the can’s filled with coke or whatever and after that the top of the can is trimmed and then bent over to secure the lid. I: That’s right, it looks like a seam. We could even do a blow-up of it like this F-L-A-N-G-E ... D: Yes, that would be clearer. I think we should label the lid itself and say that it constitutes twenty five percent of the total weight. Q30 I: Twenty-five percent … so it’s stronger than the body of the can. D: So to save money, manufacturers make it smaller than the rest of the can! I: Didn’t know that either ... so how do we open a can of coke? D: Mmm … first of all there’s the tab which we pull up to open the can and that’s held in place by a rivet. I: Mmm … I think that’s too small for us to include. D: I agree, but we can talk about it in the presentation. We can show the opening though Q31 I: That’s the bit of the can that drops down into the drink when we pull the tab. D: Yeah, hopefully. Sometimes the tab just breaks off. I: I know. D: Anyway the opening is scored so that it pushes in easily but doesn’t detach itself. I: OK, we can show that by drawing a shadow of it inside the can, like this I’ll label it scored opening. Great … well, I think we’ve got the basis of a really interesting presentation. Let’s go and photocopy the article. D: Fine. I’ll take it home and study it some more.

SECTION 4
Lecturer: Good morning and welcome to the University’s Open Day and to our mini-lecture from the Sports Studies department. Now the purpose of this lecture is twofold: one — we want you to experience a university lecture, to give you a taste of what Q32 listening to a university lecture is like, and two — we want you to find out something about the Sports Studies program at this university. So feel free to ask Q33 any questions during the talk and I’ll do my best to answer them. Right — so what does a course in Sports Studies involve? Well, you wouldn’t be blamed for not knowing the answer to this question because Sports Studies as a discipline is still comparatively new. But it’s a growing area and one which is now firmly established at our university. Now there are three distinct strands to Sports Studies and you would need to choose fairly early on just which direction you wanted to follow. And I’ll just run over these now. Firstly, we’ve got the Sports Psychology strand, secondly, we’ve got the Sports Management strand, and last, but not least, there’s the Sports Q34 Physiology strand. So Just to recap there’s Sports Psychology, Sports Management, and Sports Physiology. Let’s look first at Psychology. Now the people who study Sports Psych want to work with top athletes, and they’re looking at what will take those athletes that Q35 one percent extra. What makes them win? When all other things are equal, Q36 physically all other things are equal, they want to know … what are the mental factors involved? The Sports Psychologist works closely with the athlete through his or her training program and becomes an integral part of the team. In fact you could say that they play just as important a role as the coach. So if you’re interested in what makes people win this could be the area for you. Now secondly, we’ve got the strand which I referred to as Sports Management and this goes hand in hand with the area of Sports Marketing. So you might like to think of this area as having two branches: Management and Marketing. On the Management side we look at issues relating to the running of sports clubs, management of athletes that sort of thing. But then on the other side, we’ve got Sports Marketing. And this is the side that interests me more because here we will look at the market forces behind sport. Questions like: why do people spend their Q37 money on a football match, or a tennis game rather, than say on buying a CD or going to the cinema? What are those market forces? Sport used to just compete with sport. Nowadays it competes with other leisure activities. The spectators go to sport to be entertained rather than out of loyalty to Q38 a team. They want to have an evening out and they don’t want the cheap seats any more they want good seats they want entertainment. And the professional Q39 sportsmen and women respond to this without question. They’re there to give a performance. They provide the entertainment. So in the marketing course we address all these commercial issues and we look at how this hooks back into the Management of sport. Now the third branch of Sports Studies sometimes comes under another name and is also known as Exercise Science. And again here we find that there are two Q40 distinct types of exercise science. The first is working very much at the macro level. What I call the huffing and puffing people. So this looks at fitness testing, body
129
Tapescripts
measurements, all that sort of thing. But the more interesting side of sports Q41 physiology, at least in my view, is the side that looks at the micro level, looking at cellular change. They’re doing cellular research, looking at changes in body cells Q42 when the body is under stress.
So that just about brings us to the end of our mini-lecture for today. I hope you’ve found it interesting and I look forward to seeing you all on our course next year. Feel free to come and talk to me if you want any more information. I’ll be over at that notice board near the main entrance.

Questions 1-8
Questions 9-15
Suggested approach • Read the task rubric carefully. In this task you have to decide which match is being described in each question. • Decide what information is best to skim for in the passage: the type of match or the description. In this question it is best to skim for the types of match as these are names, some of which are in italics, they are easier for you to pick out. • Skim through the text until you find match A, the Ethereal Match. • Read that section of the text and underline any important features of this match. • Read through the descriptions and write A next to any that fit this type of match.
   If you think there is more than one possible description for the match, note A next to both. (The rubric states that you may use any match more than once. ) • Towards the top of the second page of the text it states that the Ethereal Match consisted of a “sealed glass tube”, so A is the answer to question 14. Note that the description is expressed differently from the text. Sometimes you have to match the meaning rather than the words. • If you think none of the descriptions fits this type of match, go on to the next the rubric also states that there are not enough descriptions to fit all the matches.

Questions 16-25
Questions 26-28
Suggested approach • Read the task rubric carefully. Only three of the factors in the list are correct. The correct factors explain why the author doubts the value of the WZCS document. • Scan the text and mark the section that discusses the accuracy/value of theWZCS document. This is from the third paragraph onwards. • Read through the list of factors to familiarise yourself with it. • Begin reading the third paragraph more carefully, looking for phrases that signal that the writer is going to discuss something that is wrong with the document. The first signal is:
'This is probably the document's first failing …' You can infer from what the writer   then states, that A is one of the correct factors. • Re-read the list of factors from B-F. • Continue reading the text, looking for other signals. • Select the two other correct factors. Remember that if you put more than one factor beside each question number on your answer sheet, you will not get any marks. However the three correct answers can be written down in any order.

Suggested approach • Read the task rubric carefully. You have to decide which effect arose from each cause. • Decide which list you should work from. In this case it is better to work from List A as you must find an effect m List B for every question. The causes also come first chronologically in the cause/effect relationship: List B contains results of List A. • Read through List B to familiarise yourself with it. • Read item 36. • Skim through the passage until you locate the information in the text. • Read this section of the text in detail noting any effects of 36. • Read through List B again. • Select the effect of question 36. If you think there is more than one effect, mark both and come back to this item later. But remember that
only one answer is correct. • In the third paragraph it states that the increase in urban populations “helped to turn parts of cities into slums”. So the answer to question 36 is G. • Repeat this procedure with items 37-40.

READING PASSAGE 1 Right and left-handedness in humans
Questions 1-7
Suggested approach • Read the task rubric carefully. You have to match the opinions with the people who express them in the text. • Read through the list of opinions to familiarise yourself with it. • In this case it is probably best to skim through the text looking for names as these are easy to identify. So skim through the text until you come to the first name: Professor Turner. • The text states in the first paragraph that Professor Turner has studied left-handedness. It goes on to say that he noted a “distinctive asymmetry” in the human population. • Skim through the list of opinions again Number 7 states “Asymmetry is a common feature of the human body”. So the answer to question 7 is E. • Continue this procedure with the rest of the text. Note that the opinions in the questions are expressed differently from the text. This is known as “paraphrasing”. It means that you will have to match the meaning rather than the exact words

READING PASSAGE 2 Migratory beekeeping
Questions 13-19
Suggested approach • Read the task rubric carefully. You have to complete the flow chart of the movements of a migratory beekeeper. • Read through the flow chart to familiarise yourself with it. • Scan the text and note the section that discusses the beekeepers’ movements. In this case, the information is scattered throughout the text, so it is important to have a good idea of what you are looking for. • Go back to the first box in the flow chart. Note that this box focuses on the start of migration. • Re-skim the text until you come to this information. It is cued in the fourth paragraph: “By early March …” • The flow chart will express the movements differently from the text. This is called “paraphrasing”. The fourth paragraph is all about the beekeepers’ preparations. So the answer to item 13 is “prepare”. • Go on to item 14. Remember that you will not use all the words in the box, and although some of the words in the box may seem to fit in the gaps, they have an incorrect meaning. Your summary must be an accurate reflection of what is stated in the passage.

READING PASSAGE 3 Tourism
Questions 28-37
Questions 38-41
Suggested approach • Read the task rubric carefully. By choosing the correct phrase A-H, you will make summary points of the information given in the passage. • It is obviously best to work from the questions as these are the start of each sentence. • Read through item 38. • Read through the list of phrases to familiarise yourself with them. • Skim through the passage looking for key words that indicate that the information in question 38 is going to be discussed. For item 38, this occurs in paragraph B. In the middle of the paragraph you read: “… the popular concept of tourism is that …’. But to
understand the entire point you will have to read the whole paragraph and take the gist. This is best summarised in the second sentence of the paragraph: “It is one manifestation of how work and leisure are organised as separate and regulated spheres of social practice in “modern” societies.’ So the answer to question 38 is D. • Go on to item 39 and repeat this procedure.

Note that you must use a maximum of three words for each answer, but that these do not have to be taken from the passage. • You can take a straightforward approach to this set of questions as the items are not dependent upon each other. • Read question 21 and note that you need to complete the sentence with the reason why developers prefer mass-produced housing. • Skim through the text for a reference to developers and/or mass produced housing. • This information is located in paragraph F. Here you will read the sentence: “In Europe the obstacle has been conservative local authorities and developers who prefer to ensure quick sales with conventional mass produced housing.” • From this sentence you can understand that the reason why they prefer such housing is because it sells quickly.
• Read question 21 again remembering that you have to complete the sentence using a grammatically correct form of the answer. In this case, “sell quickly” is the best answer. • Repeat this procedure with items 22-26.

READING PASSAGE 3 A workaholic economy
Questions 27-32
Suggested approach • Read the task rubric carefully. Note that you have to make a judgement about the writer’s views. • Note, also, the difference between NO (which contradicts the writer’s views) and NOT GIVEN (which means that the writer doesn’t mention this at all). • Read question 27. You have to decide whether the writer states that employees have fewer working hours today (compared with the past). • Skim through the passage to see if you can come across this information or any contradictory information. • The first paragraph states that working hours were reduced after the industrial revolution. However in the second paragraph, the writer states that “… working hours have increased noticeably since 1970 …” and if you read on this fact is reiterated.  So the statement (Q27) actually says the opposite of what the writer says. The answer to question 27 is therefore NO. • Go on to item 28 and repeat this procedure.

You have to decide which heading best fits each paragraph in the passage. • Read paragraph A and look at the example. • Skim through the list of paragraph headings to familiarise yourself with them. • Read paragraph B and underline parts that are relevant to the main focus of the paragraph. • Paragraph B begins “On the horizon” suggesting that it is going to discuss a future use of glass. It goes on to discuss fibre optics and how they could be used in the future to improve optical instruments. Phrases such as “could function hundreds of times faster” and “the surge in fibre optic use” all indicate that this paragraph is about “Exciting innovations in fibre optics”. So viii is the heading for paragraph B. • Go on to paragraph C. • If you think there is more than one possible heading for a paragraph, re-read the paragraph and try to decide which heading is most appropriate. • If you cannot decide go on to the next paragraph — you can come back to any questions that you can’t do, later.

Questions 14-23
Questions 24-27
Suggested approach • Read the task rubric carefully. Note that you must use a maximum of three words for each answer. • You can take a straightforward approach to this set of questions. • Read question 24. Note that it makes reference to the annual survey. • Skim through the text until it discusses an annual survey. This is in paragraph D. • Look for a comment on changing numbers of female managers or directors. In the text the survey is quoted as showing a “doubling of the numbers”. Thus the change referred to in the question is the fact that the numbers have doubled. • Read the question again to make sure you give a grammatically appropriate answer. In this
case, the best answer would be “it has doubled’ although “double” alone would be acceptable because it is an understandable response to the question. • Repeat this procedure with questions 25 to 27.

Questions 28-31
Questions 32-35
Suggested approach • Read the task rubric carefully. Note that these questions are based on Part B of the reading passage. You will have to decide which paragraphs in this part cover which processes. • Note that there are two extra processes which are not described. The extra processes will be close to the correct answers but not correct. Read the text carefully so that you do not fall into any traps. • Read through the list of processes to familiarise yourself with them. • Read paragraph A carefully, noting any sections that relate to the processes described in i - vi. • Paragraph A states that survival of a species is largely a “matter of chance” and that not all animals produce young at the same rate. The meaning of this paragraph can therefore be glossed as “the haphazard nature of reproduction” and vi is the correct answer to question 32. • Repeat this procedure with questions 33-35.

Questions 9-14
Suggested approach • Read the task rubric carefully. Only one option (A-D) is correct in each case. • Read question 9 and the four options. • Scan the headings in the text to see if any of them are about seating on the coach. The section entitled “Seat Allocation” refers specifically to this. • Skim through that section of the text and find out what you have to do if you want to sit at the front of the coach. • This paragraph focuses entirely on the importance of booking early if you want a particular seat. So the answel to question 9 is C.

Question 15-21
Questions 22-29
Suggested approach • Read the task rubric carefully. Note that you have to make a judgement about the list of statements. • Note the difference between information that is false (i.e. the passage says the opposite) and information that is not given (i.e. not stated in the passage at all). • Read question 22. This statement is about overnight accommodation. • Scan the paragraph headings for a reference to accommodation. The first heading is “Accommodation” • Skim through this section of the text to see if there is any information about how long you can stay at the club for. At the end of the section it states: “long and short stays welcomed”. So the answer to question 22 is True. • Repeat this procedure with questions 23-29.

PART 3
Questions 30-36
Suggested approach • Read the task rubric carefully.. You have to complete the summary by filling in the spaces with words from the passage. The words must fit in meaning and also be grammatically correct. • Read the summary to familiarise yourself with it. It may be possible to find words without reading the original text, but if you do this you may pick words which are not in the text, in which case your answer will be incorrect. So you must look for a word within the passage which has the right meaning and which is the correct part of speech for the space. • Read the first item in the summary. • Look at the text and see if you can find the same information there. For item 30, the first sentence discusses the qualities of paper that make it different from other waste products. The text states that paper comes from a “sustamable resource”. So “sustamable” is a correct answer. • Sometimes there are alternative answers that are correct in this type of question. For item 30, “replaceable” is also a possible answer because it says a little further on in the text, “trees are replaceable”. • Note however that “renewable” is not an acceptable answer because although it is a synonym and makes sense, it is not in the original text.

The chart below shows the amount of money per week spent on fast foods in Britain. The graph shows the trends in consumption of fast-foods.
Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.
You should write at least 150 words.
Model answer 165 words
The chart shows that high income earners consumed considerably more fast foods than the other income groups, spending more than twice as much on hamburgers (43 pence per person per week) than on fish and chips or pizza (both under 20 pence). Average income earners also favoured hamburgers, spending 33 pence per person per week, followed by fish and chips at 24 pence, then pizza at 11 pence. Low income earners appear to spend less than other income groups on fast foods, though fish and chips remains their most popular fast food, followed by hamburgers and then pizza. From the graph we can see that in 1970, fish and chips were twice as popular as burgers, pizza being at that time the least popular fast food. The consumption of hamburgers and pizza has risen steadily over the 20 year period to 1990 while the consumption of fish and chips has been in decline over that same period with a slight increase in popularity since 1985.

It has often been said that “Good news is bad news” because it does not sell newspapers. A radio station that once decided to present only good news soon found that it had gone out of business for lack of listeners. Bad news on the other hand is so common that in order to cope with it, we often simply ignore it. We have become immune to bad news and the newspapers and radio stations are aware of this. While newspapers and TV stations may aim to report world events accurately, be they natural or human disasters, political events or the horrors of war, it is also true that their main objective is to sell newspapers and attract listeners and viewers to their stations. For this reason TV and radio stations attempt to reflect the flavour of their station by providing news broadcasts tailor-made to suit their listeners’ preferences. Programmes specialising in pop music or TV soap operas focus more on local news, home issues and up-to-date traffic reports. The more serious stations and newspapers like to provide “so called” objective news reports with editorial comment aimed at analysing the situation. If it is true, then, that newspapers and TV stations are tailoring their news to their readers’ and viewers’ requirements, how can they possibly be reporting real world events in an honest and objective light? Many radio and TV stations do, in fact, report items of good news but they no longer call this news. They refer to these as human interest stories and package them in programmes specialising, for instance, in consumer affairs or local issues. Good news now comes to us in the form of documentaries the fight against children’s cancer or AIDS, or the latest developments in the fight to save the planet from environmental pollution.

Dear Sir, I am writing in reply to a letter I received from you a few days ago. In your letter you state that I am $240 overdrawn and that you will be charging me $70. I would like to point out that the reason I am overdrawn is because of a mistake made by your bank. If you look through your records you will see that I wrote several weeks ago explaining the situation. For the last twelve months, I have been paying $300 a month for a car I bought last summer. The monthly payments were taken directly from my bank account. However, two months ago I sold the car and I wrote to you instructing you to stop paying the monthly instalments. I received a letter from you acknowledging my request, but, for some reason, nothing was done about it. Another $300 instalment has been paid this month and this is the reason why I am overdrawn.

We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in businesses, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we he more auspicious of their benefits?
You should write at least 250 words.
Model answer 287 words
Answer keys
Computers are a relatively new invention. The first computers were built fifty years ago and it is only in the last thirty or so years that their influence has affected our everyday life. Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties. In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives. We are now so dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine what things would be like today without them. You have only got to go into a bank when their main computer is broken to appreciate the chaos that would occur if computers were suddenly removed world-wide. In the future computers will be used to create bigger and even more sophisticated computers. The prospects for this are quite alarming. They will be so complex that no individual could hope to understand how they work. They will bring a lot of benefits but they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos. They will, for example, be able to fly planes and they will be able to co ordinate the movements of several planes in the vicinity of an airport. Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go wrong. If one small program fails — disaster. There is a certain inevitability that technology will progress and become increasingly complex. We should, however, ensure that we are still in a position where we are able to control technology. It will be all too easy to suddenly discover that technology is controlling us. By then it might be too late I believe that it is very important to be suspicious of the benefits that computers will bring and to make sure that we never become totally dependent on a completely technological world.
HOW SHOULD YOU INTERPRET YOUR SCORES?
In the Answer key at the end of the each set of Listening and Reading answers you will find a chart which will help you assess if, on the basis of your practice test results, you are ready to take the IELTS exam. In interpreting your score, there are a number of points you should bear in mind. Your performance in the real IELTS test will be reported in two ways: there will be a Band Score from 1 to 9 for each of the modules and an Overall Band Score from 1 to 9, which is the average of your scores in the four modules. However, institutions considering your application are advised to look at both the Overall Band and the Bands for each module. They do this in order to see if you have the language skills needed for a particular course of study. For example, if your course has a lot of reading and writing, but no lectures, listening comprehension might be less important and a score of 5 in Listening might be acceptable if the Overall Band Score was 7. However, for a course where there are lots of lectures and spoken instructions, a score of 5 in Listening might be unacceptable even though the Overall Band Score was 7. Once you have marked your papers you should have some idea of whether your Listening and Reading skills are good enough for you to try the real IELTS test. If you did well enough in one module but not in others, you will have to decide for yourself whether you are ready to take the proper test yet. The Practice Tests have been checked so that they are about the same level of difficulty as the real IELTS test. However, we cannot guarantee that your score in the Practice Test papers will be reflected in the real IELTS test. The Practice Tests can only give you an idea of your possible future performance and it is ultimately up to you to make decisions based on your score. Different institutions accept different IELTS scores for different types of courses. We have based our recommendations on the average scores which the majority of institutions accept. The institution to which you are applying may, of course, require a higher or lower score than most other institutions. Sample answers or model answers are provided for the Writing tasks. The sample answers were written by IELTS candidates; each answer has been given a band score and the candidate's performance is described. Please note that the examiner's guidelines for marking the Writing scripts are very detailed. There are many different ways a candidate may achieve a particular band score. The model answers were written by an examiner as examples of very good answers, but it is important to understand that they are just one example out of many possible approaches.

Sand was driven into method. But the consortium
that won the contract for the island opted for a more aggressive approach. It assembled the worlds largest fleet of dredgers, which sucked up l50m cubic metres of clay and mud and dumped it in deeper waters. At the same time, sand was dredged from the waters and piled on top of the layer of stiff clay that the massive dredging had laid bare. Nor was the sand the only thing used. The original granite island which had hills up to 120 metres high was drilled and blasted into boulders no bigger than two metres in diameter. This provided 70m cubic metres of granite to add to the island's foundations. Because the heap of boulders does not fill the space perfectly, this represents the equivalent of 105m cubic metres of landfill. Most of the rock will become the foundations for the
airport's runways and its taxiways. The sand dredged from the waters will also be used to provide a two-metre capping layer over the granite platform. This makes it easier for utilities to dig trenches granite is unyielding stuff. Most of the terminal buildings will be placed above the site of the existing island. Only a limited amount of pile-driving is needed to support building foundations above softer areas. The completed island will be six to seven metres above sea level. In all, 350m cubic metres of material will have been moved. And much of it, like the overloads, has to be moved several times before reaching its final resting place. For example, there has to be a motorway capable of carrying 150-tonne dump-trucks; and there has to be a raised area for the 15,000 construction workers. These
are temporary; they will be removed when the airport is finished. The airport, though, is here to stay. To protect it, the new coastline is being bolstered with a formidable twelve kilometres of sea defences. The brunt of a typhoon will be deflected by the neighbouring island of Lantau; the sea walls should guard against the rest. Gentler but more persistent bad weather - the downpours of the summer monsoon - is also being taken into account. A mat-like material called geotextile is being laid across the island to separate the rock and sand layers. That will stop sand particles from being washed into the rock voids, and so causing further settlement This island is being built never to be sunk.

Changing our Understanding of Health
A The concept of health holds different meanings for different people and groups. These meanings of health have also changed over time. This change is no more evident than in Western society today, when notions of health and health promotion are being challenged and expanded in new ways.
B For much of recent Western history, health has been viewed in the physical sense only. That is, good health has been connected to the smooth mechanical operation of the body, while ill health has been attributed to a breakdown in this machine. Health in this sense has been defined as the absence of disease or illness and is seen in medical terms. According to this view, creating health for people means providing medical care to treat or prevent disease and illness. During this period, there was an emphasis on providing clean water, improved sanitation and housing. C In the late 1940s the World Health Organisation challenged this physically and medically oriented view of health. They stated that 'health is a complete state of physical, mental and social well-being and is not merely the absence of disease' (WHO, 1946). Health and the person were seen more holistically (mind/body/spirit) and not just in physical terms.
D The 1970s was a time of focusing on the prevention of disease and illness by emphasising the importance of the lifestyle and behaviour of the individual. Specific behaviours which were seen to increase risk of disease, such as smoking, lack of fitness and unhealthy eating habits, were targeted. Creating health meant providing not only medical health care, but health promotion programs and policies which would help people maintain healthy behaviours and lifestyles. While this individualistic healthy lifestyles approach to health worked for some (the wealthy members of society), people experiencing poverty, unemployment, underemployment or little control over the conditions of their daily lives benefited little from this approach. This was largely because both the healthy lifestyles approach and the medical approach to health largely ignored the social and environmental conditions affecting the health of people.
E During 1980s and 1990s there has been a growing swing away from seeing lifestyle risks as the root cause of poor health. While lifestyle factors still remain important, health is being viewed also in terms of the social, economic and environmental contexts in which people live. This broad approach to health is called the socio-ecological view of health. The broad socio-ecological view of health was endorsed at the first International Conference of Health Promotion held in 1986, Ottawa, Canada, where people from 38 countries agreed and declared that: The fundamental conditions and resources for health are peace, shelter, education, food, a viable income, a stable eco-system, sustainable resources, social justice and equity. Improvement in health requires a secure foundation in these basic requirements. (WHO, 1986) It is clear from this statement that the creation of health is about much more than encouraging healthy individual behaviours and lifestyles and providing appropriate medical care. Therefore, the creation of health must include addressing issues such as poverty, pollution, urbanisation, natural resource depletion, social alienation and poor working conditions. The social, economic and environmental contexts which contribute to the creation of health do not operate separately or independently of each other. Rather, they are interacting and interdependent, and it is the complex interrelationships between them which determine the conditions that promote health. A broad socio-ecological view of health suggests that the promotion of health must include a strong social, economic and environmental focus. F At the Ottawa Conference in 1986, a charter was developed which outlined new directions for health promotion based on the socio-ecological view of health. This charter, known as the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, remains as the backbone of health action today. In exploring the scope of health promotion it states that: Good health is a major resource for social, economic and personal development and an important dimension of quality of life. Political, economic, social, cultural, environmental, behavioural and biological factors can all favour health or be harmful to it. (WHO, 1986) The Ottawa Charter brings practical meaning and action to this broad notion of health promotion. It presents fundamental strategies and approaches in achieving health for all. The overall philosophy of health promotion which guides these fundamental strategies and approaches is one of 'enabling people to increase control over and to improve their health' (WHO, 1986).

IMPLEMENTING THE CYCLE OF SUCCESS: A CASE STUDY
Within Australia, Australian Hotels Inc employees who would fit in with its new (AHI) operates nine hotels and employs over policies. In its advertisements, the hotel 2000 permanent full-time staff, 300 stated a preference for people with some permanent part-time employees and 100 'service' experience in order to minimise casual staff. One of its latest ventures, the traditional work practices being introduced Sydney Airport hotel (SAH), opened in into the hotel. Over 7000 applicants filled in March 1995. The hotel is the closest to application forms for the 120 jobs initially Sydney Airport and is designed to provide offered at SAH.

The most crucial way, however, of improving the labour cost structure at SAH was to find better, more productive ways of providing customer service. SAH management concluded this would first require a process of 'benchmarking'. The prime objective of the benchmarking process was to compare a range of service delivery processes across a range of criteria using teams made up of employees from different departments within the hotel which interacted with each other. This process resulted in performance measures that greatly enhanced SAH's ability to improve productivity and quality. The front office team discovered through this project that a high proportion of AHI Club member reservations were incomplete. As a result, the service provided to these guests was below the standard promised to them as part of their membership agreement. Reducing the number of incomplete reservations greatly improved guest perceptions of service.
This article has been adapted and condensed from the article by R. Carter (1996), 'Implementing the cycle of success: A case study of the Sheraton Pacific Division', Asia Pacific Journal of Human Resources, 34(3): 111-23. Names and other details have been changed and report findings may have been given a different emphasis from the original. We are grateful to the author and Asia Pacific Journal of Human Resources for allowing us to use the material in this way.
In addition, a program modelled on an earlier project called 'Take Charge' was implemented. Essentially, Take Charge provides an effective feedback loop from both customers and employees. Customer comments, both positive and negative, are recorded by staff. These are collated regularly to identify opportunities for improvement. Just as importantly, employees are requested to note down their own suggestions for improvement. (AHI has set an expectation that employees will submit at least three suggestions for every one they receive from a customer.) Employee feedback is reviewed daily and suggestions are implemented within 48 hours, if possible, or a valid reason is given for non-implementation. If suggestions require analysis or data collection, the Take Charge team has 30 days in which to address the issue and come up with recommendations.
Although quantitative evidence of AHI's initiatives at SAH are limited at present, anecdotal evidence clearly suggests that these practices are working. Indeed AHI is progressively rolling out these initiatives in other hotels in Australia, whilst numerous overseas visitors have come to see how the program works.

But isolated examples do not and New Zealand. And non-English
speaking countries were by no means exempt - although the widespread use of English as an alternative language made them less open to the charge of insularity. The criticism and publicity given to this problem since the 1960s seems to have greatly improved the situation. industrial training schemes have promoted an increase in linguistic and cultural awareness. Many firms now have their own translation services; to take just one example in Britain, Rowntree Mackintosh now publish their documents in six languages (English, French, German, Dutch, Italian and Xhosa). Some firms run part-time language courses in the languages of the countries with which they are most involved; some produce their own technical glossaries, to ensure consistency when material is being translated. It is now much more readily appreciated that marketing efforts can be delayed, damaged, or disrupted by a
failure to take account of the linguistic needs of the customer. The changes in awareness have been most marked in English-speaking countries, where the realisation has gradually dawned that by no means everyone in the world knows English well enough to negotiate in it. This is especially a problem when English is not an official language of public administration, as in most parts of the Far East, Russia, Eastern Europe, the Arab world, Latin America and Frenchspeaking Africa. Even in cases where foreign customers can speak English quite well, it is often forgotten that they may not be able to understand it to the required level - bearing in mind the regional and social variation which permeates speech and which can cause major problems of listening comprehension. In securing understanding, how 'we' speak to 'them' is just as important, it appears, as how 'they' speak to 'us'.

What Is a Port City?
The port city provides a fascinating and rich understanding of the movement of people and qoods around the world. We understand a port as a centre of land-sea exchange, and as a major source of livelihood and a major force for cultural mixing. But do ports all produce a range of common urban characteristics which justify classifying port cities toqether under a single generic label? Do they have enough in common to warrant distinguishing them from other kinds of cities ?
A A port must be distinguished from a harbour. They are two very different things. Most ports have poor harbours, and many fine harbours see few ships. Harbour is a physical concept, a shelter for ships; port is an economic concept, a centre of land-sea exchange which requires good access to a hinterland even more than a sea-linked foreland. It is landward access, which is productive of goods for export and which demands imports, that is critical. Poor harbours can be improved with breakwaters and dredging if there is a demand for a port. Madras and Colombo are examples of harbours expensively improved by enlarging, dredging and building breakwaters.
B Port cities become industrial, financial and service centres and political capitals because of their water connections and the urban concentration which arises there and later draws to it railways, highways and air routes. Water transport means cheap access, the chief basis of all port cities. Many of the world's biggest cities, for example, London, New York, Shanghai, Istanbul, Buenos Aires, Tokyo, Jakarta, Calcutta, Philadelphia and San Francisco began as ports - that is, with land-sea exchange as their major function - but they have since grown disproportionately in other respects so that their port functions are no longer dominant. They remain different kinds of places from non-port cities and their port functions account for that difference.
C Port functions, more than anything else, make a city cosmopolitan. A port city is open to the world. In it races, cultures, and ideas, as well as goods from a variety of places, jostle, mix and enrich each other and the life of the city. The smell of the sea and the harbour, the sound of boat whistles or the moving tides are symbols of their multiple links with a wide world, samples of which are present in microcosm within their own urban areas.
D Sea ports have been transformed by the advent of powered vessels, whose size and draught have increased. Many formerly important ports have become economically and physically less accessible as a result. By-passed by most of their former enriching flow of exchange, they have become cultural and economic backwaters or have acquired the character of museums of the past. Examples of these are Charleston, Salem, Bristol, Plymouth, Surat, Galle, Melaka, Soochow, and a long list of earlier prominent port cities in Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America.
E Much domestic port trade has not been recorded. What evidence we have sug3ests that domestic trade was greater at all periods than external trade. Shanghai, for example, did most of its trade with other Chinese ports and inland cities. Calcutta traded mainly with other parts of India and so on. Most of any city's population is engaged in providing goods and services for the city itself. Trade outside the city is its basic function. But each basic worker requires food, housing, clothing and other such services. Estimates of the ratio of basic to service workers range from 1:4 to 1:8. F No city can be simply a port but must be involved in a variety of other activities. The port function of the city draws to it raw materials and distributes them in many other forms. Ports take advantage of the need for breaking up the bulk material where water and land transport meet and where loading and unloading costs can be minimised by refining raw materials or turning them into finished goods. The major examples here are oil refining and ore refining, which are commonly located at ports. It is not easy to draw a line around what is and is not a port function. All ports handle, unload, sort, alter, process, repack, and reship most of what they receive. A city may still be regarded as a port city when it becomes involved in a great range of functions not immediately involved with ships or docks.
G Cities which began as ports retain the chief commercial and administrative centre of the city close to the waterfront. The centre of New York is in lower Manhattan between two river mouths, the City of London is on the Thames, Shanghai along the Bund. This proximity to water is also true of Boston, Philadelphia, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Singapore, Bangkok, Hong Kong and Yokohama, where the commercial, financial, and administrative centres are still grouped around their harbours even though each city has expanded into a metropolis. Even a casual visitor cannot mistake them as anything but port cities.

ABSENTEEISM IN NURSING: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY
Strategy 2 Flexible fair rostering Where possible, staff were given the opportunity to determine their working schedule within the limits of clinical needs. Strategy 3: Individual absenteeism and
Each month, managers would analyse the pattern of absence of staff with excessive sick leave (greater than ten days per year for full-time employees). Characteristic patterns of potential 'voluntary absenteeism' such as absence before and after days off, excessive weekend and night duty absence and multiple single days off were communicated to all ward nurses and then, as necessary, followed up by action.
Results Absence rates for the six months prior to the Incentive scheme ranged from 3.69 per cent to 4.32 per cent. In the following six months they ranged between 2.87 per cent and 3.96 per cent. This represents a 20 per cent improvement. However, analysing the absence rates on a year-to-year basis, the overall absence rate was 3.60 per cent in the first year and 3.43 per cent in the following year. This represents a 5 per cent decrease from the first to the second year of the study. A significant decrease in absence over the two-year period could not be demonstrated.
Discussion The non-financial incentive scheme did appear to assist in controlling absenteeism in the short term. As the scheme progressed it became harder to secure prizes and this contributed to the program's losing momentum and finally ceasing. There were
This article has been adapted and condensed from the article by G. William and K. Slater (1996), 'Absenteeism in nursing: A longitudinal study', Asia Pacific Journal of Human Resources, 34(1): 111-21. Names and other details have been changed and report findings may have been given a different emphasis from the original. We are grateful to the authors and Asia Pacific Journal of Human Resources for allowing us to use the material in this •"' way.
mixed results across wards as well. For example, in wards with staff members who had long-term genuine illness, there was little chance of winning, and to some extent the staff on those wards were disempowered. Our experience would suggest that the long-term effects of incentive awards on absenteeism are questionable.
Over the time of the study, staff were given a larger degree of control in their rosters. This led to significant improvements in communication between managers and staff. A similar effect was found from the implementation of the third strategy. Many of the nurses had not realised the impact their behaviour was having on the organisation and their colleagues but there were also staff members who felt that talking to them about their absenteeism was 'picking' on them and this usually had a negative effect on management—employee relationships.
Conclusion Although there has been some decrease in absence rates, no single strategy or combination of strategies has had a significant impact on absenteeism per se. Notwithstanding the disappointing results, it is our contention that the strategies were not in vain. A shared ownership of absenteeism and a collaborative approach to problem solving has facilitated improved cooperation and communication between management and staff. It is our belief that this improvement alone, while not tangibly measurable, has increased the ability of management to manage the effects of absenteeism more effectively since this study.
Absence from work is a costly and disruptive problem for any organisation. The cost of absenteeism in Australia has been put at 1.8 million hours per day or $1400 million annually. The study reported here was conducted in the Prince William Hospital in Brisbane, Australia, where, prior to this time, few active steps had been taken to measure, understand or manage the occurrence of absenteeism.
Nursing Absenteeism A prevalent attitude amongst many nurses in the group selected for study was that there was no reward or recognition for not utilising the paid sick leave entitlement allowed them in their employment conditions. Therefore, they believed they may as well take the days off — sick or otherwise. Similar attitudes have been noted by James (1989), who noted that sick leave is seen by many workers as a right, like annual holiday leave.
Miller and Norton (1986), in their survey of 865 nursing personnel, found that 73 per cent felt they should be rewarded for not taking sick leave, because some employees always used their sick leave. Further, 67 per cent of nurses felt that administration was not sympathetic to the problems shift work causes to employees' personal and social lives. Only 53 per cent of the respondents
felt that every effort was made to schedule staff fairly.
In another longitudinal study of nurses working in two Canadian hospitals, Hacket Bycio and Guion (1989) examined the reasons why nurses took absence from work. The most frequent reason stated for absence was minor illness to self. Other causes, in decreasing order of frequency, were illness in family, family social function, work to do at home and bereavement.
Method In an attempt to reduce the level of absenteeism amongst the 250 Registered an Enrolled Nurses in the present study, the Prince William management introduced three different, yet potentially complementary, strategies over 18 months.
Strategy 1: Non-financial (material) incentives Within the established wage and salary system it was not possible to use hospital funds to support this strategy. However, it was possible to secure incentives from loca businesses, including free passes to entertainment parks, theatres, restaurants, etc. At the end of each roster period, the ward with the lowest absence rate would win the prize.

1 The Prince William Hospital has been trying to reduce absenteeism amongst nurses for many years.
2 Nurses in the Prince William Hospital study believed that there were benefits in taking as little sick leave as possible.
3 Just over half the nurses in the 1986 study believed that management understood the effects that shift work had on them.
4 The Canadian study found that 'illness in the family' was a greater cause of absenteeism than 'work to do at home'.

READING PASSAGE 2
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26 which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.
A There are now over 700 million motor vehicles in the world - and the number is rising by more than 40 million each year. The average distance driven by car users is growing too - from 8 km a day per person in western Europe in 1965 to 25 km a day in 1995. This dependence on motor vehicles has given rise to major problems, including environmental pollution, depletion of oil resources, traffic congestion and safety.
B While emissions from new cars are far less harmful than they used to be, city streets and motorways are becoming more crowded than ever, often with older trucks, buses and taxis, which emit excessive levels of smoke and fumes. This concentration of vehicles makes air quality in urban areas unpleasant and sometimes dangerous to breathe. Even Moscow has joined the list of capitals afflicted by congestion and traffic fumes. In Mexico City, vehicle pollution is a major health hazard.
C Until a hundred years ago, most journeys were in the 20 km range, the distance conveniently accessible by horse. Heavy freight could only be carried by water or rail. The invention of the motor vehicle brought personal mobility to the masses and made rapid freight delivery possible over a much
F Technical solutions can reduce the pollution problem and increase the fuel efficiency of engines. But fuel consumption and exhaust emissions depend on which cars are preferred by customers and how they are driven. Many people buy larger cars than they need for daily purposes or waste fuel by driving aggressively. Besides, global car use is increasing at a faster rate than the improvement in emissions and fuel efficiency which technology is now making possible.
G One solution that has been put forward is the long-term solution of designing cities and neighbourhoods so that car journeys are not necessary - all essential services being located within walking distance or easily accessible by public transport. Not only would this save energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions, it would also enhance the quality of community life, putting the

wider area. Today about 90 per cent of inland freight in the United Kingdom is carried by road. Clearly the world cannot revert to the horse-drawn wagon. Can it avoid being locked into congested and polluting ways of transporting people and goods?
D In Europe most cities are still designed for the old modes of transport. Adaptation to the motor car has involved adding ring roads, one-way systems and parking lots. In the United States, more land is assigned to car use than to housing. Urban sprawl means that life without a car is next to impossible. Mass use of motor vehicles has also killed or injured millions of people. Other social effects have been blamed on the car such as alienation and aggressive human behaviour.
E A 1993 study by the European Federation for Transport and Environment found that car transport is seven times as costly as rail travel in terms of the external social costs it entails such as congestion, accidents, pollution, loss of cropland and natural habitats, depletion of oil resources, and so on. Yet cars easily surpass trains or buses as a flexible and convenient mode of personal transport. It is unrealistic to expect people to give up private cars in favour of mass transit.
emphasis on people instead of cars. Good local government is already bringing this about in some places. But few democratic communities are blessed with the vision - and the capital - to make such profound changes in modern lifestyles.
H A more likely scenario seems to be a combination of mass transit systems for travel into and around cities, with small 'low emission' cars for urban use and larger hybrid or lean burn cars for use elsewhere. Electronically tolled highways might be used to ensure that drivers pay charges geared to actual road use. Better integration of transport systems is also highly desirable - and made more feasible by modern computers. But these are solutions for countries which can afford them. In most developing countries, old cars and old technologies continue to predominate.

A Students who want to enter the University of Montreal's Athletic Complex need more than just a conventional ID card - their identities must be authenticated by an electronic hand scanner. In some California housing estates, a key alone is insufficient to get someone in the door; his or her voiceprint must also be verified. And soon, customers at some Japanese banks will have to present their faces for scanning before they can enter the building and withdraw their money.
B All of these are applications of biometrics, a little-known but fast-growing technology that involves the use of physical or biological characteristics to identify individuals. In use for more than a decade at some highsecurity government institutions in the United States and Canada, biometrics are now rapidly popping up in the everyday world. Already, more than 10,000 facilities, from prisons to day-care centres, monitor people's fingerprints or other physical parts to ensure that they are who they claim to be. Some 60 biometric companies around the world pulled in at least $22 million last year and that grand total is expected to mushroom to at least $50 million by 1999.
C Biometric security systems operate by storing a digitised record of some unique human feature. When an authorised user wishes to enter or use the facility, the system scans the person's corresponding characteristics and attempts to match them against those on record. Systems using fingerprints, hands, voices, irises, retinas and faces are already on the market. Others using typing patterns and even body odours are in various stages of development.
D Fingerprint scanners are currently the most widely deployed type of biometric application, thanks to their growing use over the last 20 years by law-enforcement agencies. Sixteen American states now use biometric fingerprint verification systems to check that people claiming welfare payments are genuine. In June, politicians in Toronto voted to do the same, with a pilot project beginning next year.
E To date, the most widely used commercial biometric system is the handkey, a type of hand scanner which reads the unique shape, size and irregularities of people's hands. Originally developed for nuclear power
)
plants, the handkey received its big break when it was used to control ' access to the Olympic Village in Atlanta by more than 65,000 athletes, trainers and support staff. Now there are scores of other applications.
F Around the world, the market is growing rapidly. Malaysia, for example, is preparing to equip all of its airports with biometric face scanners to match passengers with luggage. And Japan's largest maker of cash dispensers is developing new machines that incorporate iris scanners. The first commercial biometric, a hand reader used by an American firm to monitor employee attendance, was introduced in 1974. But only in the past few years has the technology improved enough for the prices to drop sufficiently to make them commercially viable. 'When we started four years ago, I had to explain to everyone what a biometric is,' says one marketing expert. 'Now, there's much more awareness out there.'
C Not surprisingly, biometrics raise thorny questions about privacy and the potential for abuse. Some worry that governments and industry will be tempted to use the technology to monitor individual behaviour. 'If someone used your fingerprints to match your health-insurance records with a credit-card record showing you regularly bought lots of cigarettes and fatty foods,' says one policy analyst, 'you would see your insurance payments go through the roof.' In Toronto, critics of the welfare fingerprint plan complained that it would stigmatise recipients by forcing them to submit to a procedure widely identified with criminals.
H Nonetheless, support for biometrics is growing in Toronto as it is in many other communities. In an increasingly crowded and complicated world, biometrics may well be a technology whose time has come.

READING PASSAGE 1
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13 which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.
Green Wave Washes Over Mainstream Shopping
Research in Britain has shown that green consumers' continue to flourish as a significant group amongst shoppers. This suggests that politicians who claim environmentalism is yesterday's issue may be seriously misjudging the public mood. A report from Mintel, the market research organisation, says that despite recession and financial pressures, more people than ever want to buy environmentally friendly products and a 'green wave' has swept through consumerism, taking in people previously untouched by environmental concerns. The recently published report also predicts that the process will repeat itself with 'ethical' concerns, involving issues such as fair trade with the Third World and the social record of businesses. Companies will have to be more honest and open in response to this mood. Mintel's survey, based on nearly 1,000 consumers, found that the proportion who look for green products and are prepared to pay more for them has climbed from 53 per cent in 1990 to around 60 per cent in 1994. On average, they will pay 13 per cent more for such products, although this percentage is higher among women, managerial and
professional groups and those aged 35 to 44. Between 1990 and 1994 the proportion of consumers claiming to be unaware of or unconcerned about green issues fell from 18 to 10 per cent but the number of green spenders among older people and manual workers has risen substantially. Regions such as Scotland have also caught up with the south of England in their environmental concerns. According to Mintel, the image of green consumerism as associated in the past with the more eccentric members of society has virtually disappeared. The consumer research manager for Mintel, Angela Hughes, said it had become firmly established as a mainstream market. She explained that as far as the average person is concerned environmentalism has not gone off the boil'. In fact, it has spread across a much wider range of consumer groups, ages and occupations. Mintel's 1994 survey found that 13 per cent of consumers are 'very dark green', nearly always buying environmentally friendly products, 28 per cent are 'dark green', trying 'as far as possible' to buy such products, and 21 per cent are 'pale green' - tending to buy green products if they see them. Another 26 per cent are
'armchair greens'; they said they care services they buy, including the policies about environmental issues but their of the companies that provide them and concern does not affect their spending that this will require a greater degree of habits. Only 10 per cent say they do not honesty with consumers, care about green issues. Among green consumers, animal Four in ten people are 'ethical testing is the top issue - 48 per cent said spenders', buying goods which do not, they would be deterred from buying a for example, involve dealings with product it if had been tested on animals oppressive regimes. This figure is the followed by concerns regarding same as in 1990, although the number of irresponsible selling, the ozone layer, 'armchair ethicals' has risen from 28 to river and sea pollution, forest destruction, 35 per cent and only 22 per cent say they recycling and factory farming. However, are unconcerned now, against 30 per concern for specific issues is lower than cent in 1990. Hughes claims that in the in 1990, suggesting that many twenty-first century, consumers will be consumers feel that Government and encouraged to think more about the business have taken on the entire history of the products and environmental agenda.

READING PASSAGE 2
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26 which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.
A There is a great concern in Europe and North America about declining standards of literacy in schools. In Britain, the fact that 30 per cent of 16 year olds have a reading age of 14 or less has helped to prompt massive educational changes. The development of literacy has far-reaching effects on general intellectual development and thus anything which impedes the development of literacy is a serious matter for us all. So the hunt is on for the cause of the decline in literacy. The search so far has focused on socioeconomic factors, or the effectiveness of 'traditional' versus 'modern' teaching techniques.
B The fruitless search for the cause of the increase in illiteracy is a tragic example of the saying 'They can't see the wood for the trees'. When teachers use picture books, they are simply continuing a long-established tradition that is accepted without question. And for the past two decades, illustrations in reading primers have become increasingly detailed and obtrusive, while language has become impoverished — sometimes to the point of extinction.
C Amazingly, there is virtually no empirical evidence to support the use of illustrations in teaching reading. On the contrary, a great deal of empirical evidence shows that pictures interfere in a damaging way with all aspects of learning to read. Despite this, from North America to the Antipodes, the first books that many school children receive are totally without text.
D A teacher's main concern is to help young beginner readers to develop not only the ability to recognise words, but the skills necessary to understand what these words mean. Even if a child is able to read aloud fluently, he or she may not be able to understand much of it: this is called 'barking at text'. The teacher's task of improving comprehension is made harder by influences outside the classroom. But the adverse effects of such things as television, video games, or limited language experiences at home, can be offset by experiencing 'rich' language at school.
E Instead, it is not unusual for a book of 30 or more pages to have only one sentence full of repetitive phrases. The artwork is often marvellous, but the pictures make the language redundant, and the children have no need to imagine anything when they read such books. Looking at a picture actively prevents children younger than nine from creating a mental image, and can make it difficult for older children. In order to learn how to comprehend, they need to practise making their own meaning in response to text. They need to have their innate powers of imagination trained.
F As they grow older, many children turn aside from books without pictures, and it is a situation made more serious as our culture becomes more visual. It is hard to wean children off picture books when pictures have played a major part throughout their formative reading experiences, and when there is competition for their attention from so many other sources of entertainment. The least intelligent are most vulnerable, but tests show that even intelligent children are being affected. The response of educators has been to extend the use of pictures in books and to simplify the language, even at senior levels. The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge recently held joint conferences to discuss the noticeably rapid decline in literacy among their undergraduates.
G Pictures are also used to help motivate children to read because they are beautiful and eye-catching. But motivation to read should be provided by listening to stories well read, where children imagine in response to the story. Then, as they start to read, they have this experience to help them understand the language. If we present pictures to save children the trouble of developing these creative skills, then I think we are making a great mistake.
H Academic journals ranging from educational research, psychology, language learning, psycholinguistics, and so on cite experiments which demonstrate how detrimental pictures are for beginner readers. Here is a brief selection:
I The research results of the Canadian educationalist Dale Willows were clear and consistent: pictures affected speed and accuracy and the closer the pictures were to the words, the slower and more inaccurate the child's reading became. She claims that when children come to a word they already know, then the pictures are unnecessary and distracting. If they do not know a word and look to the picture for a clue to its meaning, they may well be misled by aspects of the pictures which are not closely related to the meaning of the word they are trying to understand.
J Jay Samuels, an American psychologist, found that poor readers given no pictures learnt significantly more words than those learning to read with books with pictures. He examined the work of other researchers who had reported problems with the use of pictures and who found that a word without a picture was superior to a word plus a picture.When children were given words and pictures, those who seemed to ignore the pictures and pointed at the words learnt more words than the children who pointed at the pictures, but they still learnt fewer words than the children who had no illustrated stimuli at all.

READING PASSAGE 3
You should spend about 26 minutes on Questions 27-40 which are based on Reading Passage 3 below. v
It has been called the Holy Grail of modern biology. Costing more than £2 billion, it is the most ambitious •scientific project since the Apollo programme that landed a man on the moon. And it will take longer to accomplish than the lunar missions, for it will not be complete until early next century. Even before it is finished, according to those involved, this project should open up new understanding of, and new treatments for, many of the ailments that afflict humanity. As a result of the Human Genome Project, there will be new hope of liberation from the shadows of cancer, heart disease, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and some psychiatric illnesses. The objective of the Human Genome Project is simple to state, but audacious in scope: to map and analyse every single gene within the double helix of humanity's DNA1. The project will reveal a new human anatomy — not the bones, muscles and sinews, but the complete
genetic blueprint for a human being. Those working on the Human Genome Project claim that the new genetical anatomy will transform medicine and reduce human suffering in the twenty-first century. But others see the future through a darker glass, and fear that the project may open the door to a world peopled by Frankenstein's monsters and disfigured by a new eugenics2. The genetic inheritance a baby receives from its parents at the moment of conception fixes much of its later development, determining characteristics as varied as whether it will have blue eyes or suffer from a lifethreatening illness such as cystic fibrosis. The human genome is the compendium of all these inherited genetic instructions. Written out along the double helix of DNA are the chemical letters of the genetic text. It is an extremely long text, for the human genome contains more than 3 billion letters: On the printed page it would fill about 7,000 volumes. Yet,
within little more than a decade, the position of every letter and its relation to its neighbours will have been tracked down, analysed and recorded. Considering how many letters there are in the human genome, nature is an excellent proof-reader. But sometimes there are mistakes. An error in a single 'word' — a gene - can give rise to the crippling condition of cystic fibrosis, the commonest genetic disorder among Caucasians. Errors in the genetic recipe for haemoglobin, the protein that gives blood its characteristic red colour and which carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, give rise to the most common singlegene disorder in the world: thalassaemia. More than 4,000 such single-gene defects are known to afflict humanity. The majority of them are fatal; the majority of the victims are children. None of the single-gene disorders is a disease in the conventional sense, for which it would be possible to
administer a curative drug: the defect is pre-programmed into every cell of the sufferer's body. But there is hope of progress. In 1986,. American researchers identified the genetic defect underlying one type of muscular dystrophy. In 1989, a team of American and Canadian biologists announced that they had found the site of the gene which, when defective, gives rise to cystic fibrosis. Indeed, not only had they located the gene, they had analysed the sequence of letters within it and had identified the mistake responsible for the condition. At the least, these scientific advances may offer a way of screening parents who might be at risk of transmitting a single-gene defect to any children that they conceive. Foetuses can be tested while in the womb, and if found free of the genetic defect, the parents will be relieved of worry and stress, knowing that they will be delivered of a baby free from the disorder. In the mid-1980s, the idea gained currency within the scientific world that the techniques which were successfully deciphering disorder-related genes could

Momentum quickly built up behind the Human Genome Project and its objective of 'sequencing' the entire genome - writing out all the letters in their correct order. But the consequences of the Human Genome Project go far beyond a narrow focus on disease. Some of its supporters have made claims of great extravagance - that the Project will bring us to understand, at the most fundamental level, what it is to be human. Yet many people are concerned that such an emphasis on humanity's genetic constitution may distort our sense of values, and lead us to forget that human life is more than just the expression of a genetic program written in the chemistry of DNA. If properly applied, the new knowledge generated by the Human Genome Project may free humanity from the terrible scourge of diverse diseases. But if the new knowledge is not used wisely, it also holds the threat of creating new forms of
discrimination and new methods of oppression. Many characteristics, such as height and intelligence, result not from the action of genes alone, but from subtle interactions between genes and the environment. What would be the implications if humanity were to understand, with precision, the genetic constitution which, given the same environment, will predispose one person towards a higher intelligence than another individual whose genes were differently shuffled? Once before in this century, the relentless curiosity of scientific researchers brought to light forces of nature in the power of the atom, the mastery of which has shaped the destiny of nations and overshadowed all our lives. The Human Genome Project holds the promise that, ultimately, we may be able to alter our genetic inheritance if we so choose. But there is the central moral problem: how can we ensure that when we choose, we choose correctly? That such a potential is a promise and not a threat? We need only look at the past to understand the danger.

WEST THAMES COLLEGE BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR CANDIDATES
West Thames College (initially known as Hounslow Borough College) came into existence in 1976 following the merger of Isleworth Polytechnic with part of Chiswick Polytechnic. Both parent colleges, in various guises, enjoyed a long tradition of service to the community dating back to the 1890s. The college is located at London Road, Isleworth, on a site occupied by the Victorian house of the Pears family. Spring Grove House. An earlier house of the same name on this site had been the home of Sir Joseph Banks, the botanist who named Botany Bay with Captain Cook in 1770. Later he founded Kew Gardens. Situated at the heart of West London, West Thames College is ideally placed to serve the training and education needs of local industry and local people. But its influence reaches much further than the immediate locality. Under its former name, Hounslow Borough College, it had already established a regional, national and international reputation for excellence. In fact, about eight per cent of its students come from continental Europe and further afield, whilst a further 52 per cent are from outside the immediate area. Since 1 April 1993, when it became independent of the local authority and adopted its new title, West Thames College has continued to build on that first class reputation. These days there is no such thing as a © West Thames College 1996 typical student. More than half of West Thames College's 6000 students are over 19 years old. Some of these will be attending college part-time under their employers' training schemes. Others will want to learn new skills purely out of interest, or out of a desire to improve their promotion chances, or they may want a change in career. The college is also very popular with 16-18 year olds, who see it as a practical alternative to a further two years at school. They want to study in the more adult atmosphere the college provides. They can choose from a far wider range of subjects than it would be practical for a sixth form to offer. If they want to go straight into employment they can still study at college to gain qualifications relevant to the job, either on a day-release basis or through Network or the Modern Apprenticeship Scheme.

SECTION 3 Questions 2 7-40
Read the following passage and answer Questions 27-40.
The Discovery of Uranus
Someone once put forward an attractive though unlikely theory. Throughout the Earth's annual revolution around the sun there is one point of space always hidden from our eyes. This point is the opposite part of the Earth's orbit, which is always hidden by the sun. Could there be another planet there, essentially similar to our own, but always invisible? If a space probe today sent back evidence that such a world existed it would cause not much more sensation than Sir William Herschel's
discovery of a new planet, Uranus, in 1781. Herschel was an extraordinary man — no other astronomer has ever covered so vast a field of work — and his career deserves study. He was born in Hanover in Germany in 1738, left the German army in 1757, and arrived in England the same year with no money but quite exceptional music ability. He played the violin and oboe and at one time was organist in the Octagon Chapel in the city of Bath. Herschel's was an active
mind, and deep inside he was conscious that music was not his destiny; he therefore read widely in science and the arts, but not until 1772 did he come across a book on astronomy. He was then 34, middle-aged by the standards of the time, but without hesitation he embarked on his new career, financing it by his professional work as a musician. He spent years mastering the art of telescope construction, and even by present-day standards his instruments are comparable with the best.
Serious observation began in 1774. He set himself the astonishing task of 'reviewing the heavens', in other words, pointing his telescope to every accessible part of the sky and recording what he saw. The first review was made in 1775; the second, and most momentous, in 1780-81. It was during the latter part of this that he discovered Uranus. Afterwards, supported by the royal grant in recognition of his work, he was able to devote himself entirely to astronomy. His final achievements spread from the sun and moon to remote galaxies (of which he discovered hundreds), and papers flooded from his pen until his death in 1822. Among these there was one sent to the Royal Society in 1781, entitled An Account of a Comet. In his own words:
On Tuesday the 13th of March, between ten and eleven in the evening, while I was examining the small stars in the neighbourhood of H Geminorum, I perceived one that appeared visibly larger than the rest; being struck with its uncommon magnitude, I compared it to H Geminorum and the small star in the quartile between Auriga and
Gemini, and finding it to be much larger than either of them, suspected it to be a comet.
Herschel's care was the hallmark of a great observer; he was not prepared to jump to any conclusions. Also, to be fair, the discovery of a new planet was the last thought in anybody's mind. But further observation by other astronomers besides Herschel revealed two curious facts. For a comet, it showed a remarkably sharp disc; furthermore, it was moving so slowly that it was thought to be a great distance from the sun, and comets are only normally visible in the immediate vicinity of the sun. As its orbit came to be worked out the truth dawned that it was a new planet far beyond Saturn's realm, and that the 'reviewer of the heavens' had stumbled across an unprecedented prize. Herschel wanted to call it georgium sidus (Star of George) in honour of his royal patron King George III of Great Britain. The planet was later for a time called Herschel in honour of its discoverer. The name Uranus, which was first proposed by the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode, was in use by the late 19th century.
Uranus is a giant in construction, but not so much in size; its diameter compares unfavourably with that of Jupiter and Saturn, though on the terrestrial scale it is still colossal. Uranus' atmosphere consists largely of hydrogen and helium, with a trace of methane. Through a telescope the planet appears as a small bluish-green disc with a faint green periphery. In 1977, while recording the occultation1 of a star behind the planet, the American astronomer James L. Elliot discovered the presence of five rings encircling the equator of Uranus. Four more rings were discovered in January 1986 during the exploratory flight of Voyager 22, In addition to its rings, Uranus has 15 satellites ('moons'), the last 10 discovered by Voyager 2 on the same flight; all revolve about its equator and move with the planet in an east—west direction. The two largest moons, Titania and Oberon, were discovered by Herschel in 1787. The next two, Umbriel and Ariel, were found in 1851 by the British astronomer William Lassell. Miranda, thought before 1986 to be the innermost moon, was discovered in 1948 by the American astronomer Gerard Peter Kuiper.

32 Paragraph G
A The newspaper production process has come a long way from the old days when the paper was written, edited, typeset and ultimately printed in one building with the journalists working on the upper floors and the printing presses going on the ground floor. These days the editor, subeditors and journalists who put the paper together are likely to find themselves in a totally different building or maybe even in a different city. This is the situation which now prevails in Sydney. The daily paper is compiled at the editorial headquarters, known as the pre-press centre, in the heart of the city but printed far away in the suburbs at the printing centre. Here human beings are in the minority as much of the work is done by automated machines controlled by computers.
B Once the finished newspaper has been created for the next morning's edition, all the pages are transmitted electronically from the pre-press centre to the printing centre. The system of
transmission is an update on the sophisticated page facsimile system already in use on many other newspapers. An image-setter at the printing centre delivers the pages as film. Each page takes less than a minute to produce, although for colour pages four versions are used, one each for black, cyan, magenta and yellow. The pages are then processed into photographic negatives and the film is used to produce aluminium printing plates ready for the presses.
C A procession of automated vehicles is busy at the new printing centre where the Sydney Morning Herald is printed each day. With lights flashing and warning horns honking, the robots (to give them their correct name, the LGVs or laser-guided vehicles) look for all the world like enthusiastic machines from a science-fiction movie, as they follow their own random paths around the plant busily getting on with their jobs. Automation of this kind is now standard
in all modern newspaper plants. The robots can the press. If not needed immediately, an LGV detect unauthorised personnel and alert takes it to the storage area. When the press security staff immediately if they find an computer calls for a reel, an LGV takes it to the 'intruder' and not surprisingly, tall tales are reel-loading area of the presses. It lifts the reel already being told about the machines starting onto the loading position and places it in the to take on personalities of their own. correct spot with complete accuracy. As each , reel is used up, the press drops the heavy D cardboard core into a waste bin, and when the The robots' principle job, however, is to shift the bin is full, another LGV collects it and deposits newsprint (the printing paper) that arrives at the cores into a shredder for recycling. the plant in huge reels and emerges at the other end some time later as newspapers. Once the F size of the day's paper and the publishing order The LGVs move at walking speed. Should are determined at head office, the information is anyone step in front of one or get too close, punched into the computer and the LGVs are sensors stop the vehicle until the path is clear, programmed to go about their work.

When the press development manager says, 'The beauty of it is needs another reel its computer alerts the LGV that if you want to change the routes, you can system. The Sydney LGVs move busily around work out a new route on your computer and lay the press room fulfilling their two key functions it down for them to follow.' When an LGVs - to collect reels of newsprint either from the batteries run low, it will take itself off line and go reel stripping stations or from the racked to the nearest battery maintenance point for supplies in the newsprint storage area. At the replacement batteries. And all this is achieved stripping station the tough wrapping that helps with absolute minimum human input and a to protect a reel of paper from rough handling much reduced risk of injury to people working in is removed.

SECTION 2
INTERVIEWER A dream came true in 1995, when over 96 days of the spring and summer, an expedition of four men undertook what they believe to have been the first and only complete end-to-end crossing of Morocco's Attora mountains. I talked to Charles Owen, the leader of the expedition group, about the trip. Charles, how much planning went on beforehand? CHARLES Well, as you know, I run these walking trips across the mountains for tourists and over the years, I've collected maps and other data to prepare Q1J what I call a 'route book' for this trip and this book basically shows the route across the mountains that we took. INTERVIEWER You actually broke records while you were out there, didn't you? CHARLES Mmm. Yes, it was 900 miles in total and we managed to climb 32 peaks Q12 that were over 3000 metres high, including Toubkal, which is of course the Q13 highest in North Africa. We weren't actually out to make a name for ourselves - it just happened really. INTERVIEWER What was the. weather like? CHARLES It got us right from day one and we were pretty taken aback really to find Q14 that it rained on quite a number of days, and so we were forced to start re-planning our route almost from the outset. One of the obvious problems is the heavy snow which blocks the mountain passes, so you have to make considerable detours. When we were on the way to Imilchil, for example, the snow forced us into a northern bypass which was new to us, but anyway, either way we would have been rewarded because we fell upon amazing, high meadows, huge gorges and wonderful snow-capped mountains. The scenery was as fine as any we saw on the trip and that was how it was every time - having to take another pass was never a Q15 disappointment.
INTERVIEWER It was in many ways a social trip, wasn't it?
CHARLES Yes, yes ... we'd arranged to meet up with friends at various points on the . journey. I mean this was actually one of the purposes of the trip . . . and we managed to keep all these dates, which is amazing really considering the Q16. detours we made. An old friend acted as a sort of transport organiser for Q17 . everyone and the Hotel Ali in Marrakech was a good social base - I'd really recommend it, although I can't remember who runs it. Anyway, groups of • Q18 friends actually joined us for three-week stints and others just linked up with us. Some, whom we hadn't met before the trip at all, tagged on for short bursts - people from the area - who just came along for the ride. But outside the major visitor areas like Toubkal we only met one other group of travellers like ourselves in the whole 96 days. INTERVIEWER Were there any bad moments? CHARLES We took two, I must say, long-suffering donkeys with us to help transport water and tents and things. I suppose if we were to do it all again we'd probably hire donkeys along the way. Taza and Tamri, as we called them Q19 after the last places in the trip, well, they made quite a unique journey between them, and ... but it was continuously demanding for them. On both the really high summits, they took diversions that were quite out of Q20 character and I can only assume that it must have been due to tiredness. INTERVIEWER Well, thank you ... And Charles has put together a video about this journey and continues to lead groups to the Attora mountains, so if you want further information ...

JANE It's going to be different from school, isn't it! TIM Yeah, particularly the lectures. Have you got any special strategy for listening to lectures? JANE Well I'm going to use a cassette recorder and record them all. Q26 TIM What! Are you allowed to? JANE Sure. Lots of people do it nowadays. It means you can listen to the lectures all over again later, and make really good notes. TIM I couldn't do that. I like to take notes as I'm listening. I usually find I get all the important points. Reading is different of course. My approach is to skim the book Q27 first to see what's important and what isn't. It saves hours of time. JANE But what if you miss something? TIM You don't mean you're going to read every word, do you? JANE Well, that's what I usually do. TIM Well, that's up to you, but I think you're crazy! JANE What's your first lecture on, anyway? TIM Oh, it's a lecture on the French Revolution. Q28 JANE The French Revolution! How boring! TIM It's not boring at all! It was an amazing period of history. It changed everything in Europe. So what's your first lecture about? JANE It's about animal behaviour. It sounds really interesting. TIM Look, I was on my way to the library. I'm going to get some of these books out and start reading for the first essay I've got to write. JANE And what have you got to write about? TIM Well, you'll never believe it, I think our professor must have a sense of humour. He's given us the title "Why study history?" Q29 JANE That's a good one. When you find the answer, let me know! TIM I'm going to enjoy writing it. Have you been given any writing assignments yet? JANE Yes, I've got to write about animal language. Q30 TIM Hmm! That sounds a challenge. I suppose you'll be off to the zoo to do field research.

LECTURER Welcome to further education Information Week. This is the Physical Education Faculty's session and I'm the Head of the Faculty. During the course of this morning we hope to give you a clear idea of what we offer in our training programs and we will look at the types of courses and the entry requirements, if any, for those courses. Some of these courses are open to school leavers, but for some you need previous qualifications, or relevant successful employment. 
So firstly, the Physical Fitness Instructor's course is offered as a six-month certificate Example course which includes an important component of personal fitness but there are no specific entry requirements. For Sports Administrators we provide a four-month certificate course but you should be Q31 aware that this is designed for those who are in employment. This employment must be Q32 current and related to sports administration. For the Sports Psychologist course we offer a one-year diploma course, but this diploma Q33 course is available only to those who already hold a degree in psychology, so you need to make sure you have that before you apply to do this course. Now . . . for Physical Education Teachers we offer a four-year degree in education. This degree course is designed for preparing students to teach in primary and secondary Schools and needs no prior qualifications as it is entered directly by school leavers. Q34 And lastly for the Recreation Officer's course we offer a six-month certificate. Entry to Q35 this course normally includes applicants of a wide range of ages and experiences, but we do not insist on any prerequisites for this course. Remember that this is a vocational training institute. We train you so that you can take up a particular kind of job. So it is important that you know the main roles of the jobs what the work is like and what kind of qualities you need to succeed at them. A Physical Fitness Instructor works in health and fitness centres preparing individual Q36 programs for ordinary members of the public. Physical Fitness Instructors prepare routines of exercises to suit the individual client's age and level of fitness. Sports Administrators run clubs and sporting associations. Their duties include such Q37 things as booking playing fields with local councils and organising the schedule of games or events for the club, so they need good organisational skills. Sports Psychologists spend time with professional athletes helping them approach Q38 competition with a positive mental attitude to enable them to achieve their personal best. They do this by improving motivation and concentration or assisting with stress management. Physical Education or PE Teachers instruct young students in how to exercise, play Q39 sport, and do other recreational activities correctly and safely. PE teachers help the development of co-ordination, balance, posture, and flexibility with things like simple catching and throwing skills. They are not expected to be experts in all sports, but must be able to show students the basic techniques involved in a wide range of activities. Recreation Officers often find themselves working for local government authorities and local groups. Their aim is to raise people's awareness of healthy lifestyles and improved Q40 general fitness through arranging recreational activities for groups of all ages from the very young to the elderly. There are many other job opportunities which our graduates can look forward to. If you are interested in any of these ...

DIANE Good morning. Diane Davies. Can I help you? GAVIN Yes, I'd like to get some insurance for the contents of my home. DIANE Fine. When did you move into the house? GAVIN A couple of weeks ago, and it's an apartment actually. I was told by the landlord Example that it would be a good idea to get some insurance for the furniture and other personal possessions. Repeal DIANE Fine. Well, let's get some details. What kind of apartment is it? GAVIN It's a two-bedroom apartment. DIANE What floor is it on? GAVIN Why do you need to know that? DIANE Because it affects the cost of the insurance. An apartment on the ground floor isn't as protected as others and there's more chance of a break-in. GAVIN Really? I didn't know that. It's on the third, no,. .. second floor. Ql DIANE Second ... and how much is the rent? GAVIN It's $615 per month. Q2 DIANE Good, and where is it located? GAVIN In Biggins St, South Hills. DIANE I see. And what things did you want to insure? GAVIN Well, what do you recommend? DIANE Well, the most important things are those which you would normally find in a home. Things like the television, fridge and so on. GAVIN I see. Well, I've got a fridge and a stereo system which I've just bought from a friend. DIANE And how much did you pay for the fridge? Q3 GAVIN Er, $450. DIANE 50 or 15? GAVIN 50, and the stereo system cost $1,150. Q4 DIANE Have you got a television? GAVIN Yes, but it's very old and not worth much. DIANE OK. Well, is there anything else you want to insure? GAVIN Yes, I've got a couple of watches and my CDs and books. DIANE How much do you think they're worth? GAVIN The watches are worth $1,000 ... DIANE For both of them? GAVIN No, each one and, all together, the CDs and books cost me about S400. Q5 DIANE OK, so the value of everything you want to insure is $4,000. GAVIN How much will the insurance cost?
DIANE: Let me see, S4.000 divided by ... plus 10% . . . right, so this kind of insurance, er, that's Private Contents insurance, it comes to $184.00 for a twelve-month Q6 period. GAVIN S184.00. Well, that sounds pretty good. OK, I'll take that policy.
GAVIN Can I arrange the policy over the phone? DIANE. Sure, just let me get the details down. So that's Mr . . . GAVIN Gavin Murray, that's M-U-R-R-A-Y. Q7
DIANE And the address is? GAVIN It's 16C Biggins Street, South Hills. Qs 8,9 DIANE OK (writing) 16C Biggins Street, South Hills? GAVIN That's right, it's two words, 'South Hills'. DIANE And your date of birth is?
GAVIN 12 November 1980. DIANE And your contact number? GAVIN Home phone number is 9872 4855. DIANE Right.. . and er,... you're Australian? GAVIN No ... I was born in London, although my mother is from Tasmania. Q10 DIANE Really? Whereabouts?
GAVIN Hobart. DIANE I see ... interesting place. Now, are you working at the moment? GAVIN No, I'm a full-time student at Sydney University. DIANE Right, good. ,
SECTION 2
COLLEGE PRESIDENT Well, good morning, everyone, it's good to see you all here. Welcome to Smith House. Smith House as you may or may not know is one of the oldest residential colleges of the university. As you can see, the building you're in now which contains this main lounge, the dining room, the recreation room, the kitchen and the offices was part of the original old Q11 house, built in the 1840s to be used by the family of George Smith. That's of course how the house and college got their names. The original house was converted into, a residential college for the university in 1940 and since then has continued to be added on to and modernised. You'll notice when you receive your room allocation in a few minutes that your room number either begins with the letter N, S, or W like this one here. The first letter refers to Q12 the three wings of the college which come away from this main building. Of course the letters represent the three directions - in this case - north, south and west. Each wing has two floors, and so the next number you see is either one, or in this case two, and this indicates which floor your room is on. The number after that is your individual room Q13 number. So it's quite simple to find any room by going to the right wing, then floor, and Q14 then room number.
You'll also notice, when you receive your orientation pack shortly, that there are two keys. One is the key to your room and only you have that key - and the other is a key to the front door which you've just come through here from the street. This door is closed and locked at 8 pm every night and opened again at 7 am. You'll need your key if you're coming back to Q15 the college between those times. We ask all students to always enter and leave the college through the front door. You will notice at the end of each corridor that there is another door but these are fire doors and are kept locked from the outside. They should only be Q16 opened from the inside in case of emergency. In your fees you've paid a laundry fee which covers the cleaning of bed linen and towels. Ql 7 All bed linen and towels are clearly embossed with the name Smith House so it's easily identifiable. If you want your other laundry to be done by the college this can be arranged for a small extra fee. There are only a few rules here at Smith House and we have these rules so that we can all live comfortably together. The most important rule is that there must be no noise after 9 pm. There is also no smoking in the rooms or anywhere inside the college but smoking is permitted on the balconies. Q]g All meals are served in the dining room. Meal times are listed in your orientation pack. Please read these carefully as meal times cannot be changed and if you arrive late I'm sorry Q19 to say you'll just go hungry. If you're unsure about things, each floor has an elected 'floor senior' who is usually a student in their third or fourth year of study who's been at Smith House for a while. The floor seniors will introduce themselves later today and answer any questions you have. But Q20 for now I'm going to hand you over to Marney who is going to give you the orientation packs and keys. Thanks Marney.

LYNNE That essay we have to write ... the one on how children learn through the media ... how are you planning to write it? ROBIN Well, I've given it some thought and I think that the best way to approach it is to divide the essay into two parts. First of all, we'd have to look at some examples of each type of media ... LYNNE Yes, what they are . .. then we could describe how we can use each medium so that children can learn something from each one. ROBIN Exactly. Maybe we could draw up a table and look at examples of each medium in turn. Let's see, the different forms of media would be... the print media ... LYNNE Here you'd have things like books and newspapers, that sort of thing ... Q21 ROBIN Urn, and included in these are the pictorial forms of print media, like maps ... LYNNE Yes, maps are really just formal pictures, aren't they? And then there are what we Q22 call the audio forms of media ... where children can listen. CDs and radios are Q23 probably the best examples, because a lot of children have access to these especially radious. ROBIN And this would lead into the audio-visual media, which can be seen as well as heard ... film, television . . . and we mustn't forget videos. Q24
LYNNE Yes, but there's a final category as well . . . computers, that make up the so- Q25 called electronic media. In the United Kingdom and Australia, they say that one in three families has a computer now. ROBIN Yes, I believe it. Well that's a good list to start with . .. we're really getting somewhere with this essay now ... so let's move on to when each type of medium could be used. I guess we could start by trying to identify the best situation for each type of media. LYNNE What do you mean? ROBIN I'm talking about whether each medium should be used with different sized groups. For example, we could look at pictures, and ask whether they're more useful for an individual child, a few children together or a full class - in this case, I'd say pictures are best with individual children, because they give them an Example opportunity to let their imaginations run wild.
LYNNE Yes, I see ... ROBIN Let's take tapes next. Although tapes look ideal for individual children, I feel Q26 they're best suited to small group work. This way, children don't feel isolated, because they can get help from their friends. Computers are the same ... I think Q27 they're better with small numbers of children and they're hardly ever useful with a whole class. Videos, however, are ideal for use with everyone present in the Q28 class, especially when children have individual activity sheets to help them focus their minds on what's in the video. LYNNE And what about books, what would you recommend for them? Books are ideal Q29 for children to use by themselves. I know they're used with groups in schools, but I wouldn't recommend it. Other pictorial media like maps, though, are different Q30 ... I'd always plan group work around those . .. give the children a chance to interact and to share ideas. ROBIN I agree ... teachers often just leave maps on the wall for children to look at when they have some free time, but kids really enjoy using them for problem solving. LYNNE Yes, different people have different ideas I suppose .. . ROBIN Yes, and different teachers recommend different tools for different age groups ...
SECTION 4
LECTURER I hope that this first session, which I've called An Introduction to British Agriculture, will provide a helpful background to the farm visits you'll be doing next week. I think I should start by emphasising that agriculture still accounts for a very important part of this country's economy. We are used to hearing the UK's society and economy described as being 'industrial' or even 'post-industrial', but we mustn't let this blind us to the fact that agriculture and its supporting industries still account for around 20% of our Gross National Product. This figure is especially impressive, I think, when you bear in mind how very small a percentage of the UK workforce is employed in agriculture. This is not a recent
development - you would have to go back to 1750 or so to find a majority of the workforce in this country working in agriculture: By the middle of the next century, in 1850 that is, it had fallen sharply to 10%, and then to 3% by the middle of the twentieth Q31 century. And now just 2% of the workforce contribute 20% of GNP. How is this efficiency achieved? Well, my own view is that it owes a great deal to a history, over the last 50 or 60 years, of intelligent support by the state, mainly taking the form of helping farmers to plan ahead. Then the two other factors I should mention, both very important, are the high Q32 level of training amongst the agricultural workforce. And secondly, the recognition by farmers of the value of investing in technology. Q33 Now, although the UK is a fairly small country, the geology and climate vary a good deal from region to region. For our purposes today we can divide the country broadly into three - I've marked them on the map here (indicates map). The region you'll get to know best, of course, is the north, where we are at present. The land here is generally hilly, and the soils thin. The climate up here, and you've already had evidence of this, is generally cool and wet. As you will see next week, the typical farm here Q34 in the North is a small, family-run concern, producing mainly wool and timber for the Q35 market. If we contrast that with the Eastern region, over here (indicating on map), the east is flatter and more low-lying, with fertile soils and a mixed climate. Average farm-size is much Q36 bigger in the east, and farms are likely to be managed strictly on commercial lines. As for crops, well, the east is the UK's great cereal-producing region. However, increasingly significant areas are now also given over to high quality vegetables for supply direct to the Q37 supermarkets.
The third broad region is the west, where it's a different story again. The climate is warmer than in the north and much wetter than in the east. The resulting rich soils in the Q38 west provide excellent pasture, and the farms there are quite large, typically around 800 Q39 hectares. The main products are milk, cheese and meat. So, clearly, there are marked differences between regions. But this does not prevent quite a strong sense of solidarity amongst the farming community as a whole, right across the country. This solidarity comes in part from the need to present a united front in dealing with other powerful interest-groups, such as government or the media. It also owes something to the close co-operation between all the agricultural training colleges, through which the great majority of farmers pass at the beginning of their careers. And a third Q40 factor making for solidarity is the national structure of the Farmers' Union, of which virtually all farmers are members. Finally in this short talk, I would like to say a little about the challenges facing farmers in the next. . .
SECTION 1
A Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, but would you have time to answer a few questions? B What's it about? A We're doing some market research for a new television channel starting in two years' time. B OK, why not? A Lovely, we'll just work through this form. And if we could start with some personal background information ... B Sure. A Right, if I could just have your age ... B 35. Example A Right, great.. . Repeat A Right, great. And your job? B Systems analyst, but for the form I don't know whether it would count as professional or business or what. A What do you think? B OK, it's more like business. Ql A Fine. And would you mind my asking about your salary? Or we can leave it blank. B No, I don't mind. It's £40,000 a year. Q2 A Thank you. Right... about your current watching habits ... what would you say is your main reason for watching TV? B Well, at work I tend to read for information and what have you, so I'd say that with TV Q3 it probably just helps me relax and unwind. A Fine. And how many hours a day on average do you watch TV? B Not a lot really ... I should say just over an hour. Q4
A So what are the two main times of the day that you watch TV? B Well, a little around breakfast time and then it tends to be really late - eleven or even Q5 midnight - when I've finished work. A And what sort of programmes do you go for? B Some news bulletins but I also really like to put my feet up with some of the old comedy shows. A Fine. And turning to the new channel... which type of programmes would you like to see more of? B Well, I certainly don't think we need any more factual programmes like news and documentaries. I think we need more about things like local information ... you know, Q6 providing a service for the community. And in the same vein, perhaps more for Q6 younger viewers .. . you know, good quality stuff.
A Ah ha. And if you had to give the new directors some specific advice when they set up the channel, what advice would you give them? B I think I'd advise them to pay a lot of attention to the quality of the actual broadcast, Q7 you know, the sound system. People are very fussy these days about that and in general I think they ought to do lots more of these kinds of interview, you know, talking with Q7 their potential customers. A Oh, I'm glad you think it's valuable! B Certainly ... yeah. A Good. OK, this will be a commercial channel of course, but how often do you think it is tolerable to have adverts? B Well out of that list I'd say every quarter of an hour. 1 don't think we can complain Q8 about that, as long as they don't last for ten minutes each time! A Quite. And ... would you be willing to attend any of our special promotions for the new channel? B Yes, I'd be very happy to, as long as they're held here in my area. Q9 A OK, I'll make a note of that. And finally, may we put you on our mailing list? B Well, I'd prefer not. .. except for the information about the promotion you mentioned. Q10 A Can I have your name and address? B Of course ... here's my card. A Oh, lovely... and thank you very much for your time and we look forward to seeing you. B Yes, indeed. Urn, thanks.
SECTION 2
ELIZABETH OK, well, good morning everybody! My name's Elizabeth Reed and I'm your Assistant Welfare Officer. What I'd like to do now is tell you a little more about some of the er ... the social facilities available on the campus, and also to tell you something about what the town has to offer. As you probably know already, the Student Union Building is the main centre of social life here, as indeed it is in most British Universities. The Union runs a weekly programme of events for all tastes ... oh everything from discos to talks by guest speakers. Many of these events are fund raising Qll activities for charities, which the Union takes very seriously. They manage the Students' Union papershop, selling magazines and newspapers, as well as Q12 stationery, sweets and so on. Um ... Then ... er, let me see... there's the Ticket Shop, where you can get some very good deals on, well for example, Q13 coaches to London or inexpensive charter flights, as cheap as you'll get anywhere people say, or tickets for big pop groups playing here or at other venues all over the country, or plays in London - oh and we mustn't forget the Union Cafeteria and the Big New Diner... Er ... yes? Did you have a QJ4 question? STUDENT Yes, does the Union also provide help with any problems, I mean advice on financial problems, for example? Or does the University provide that?
ELIZABETH: Yes, the Union run their own advice service, offering help with financial Q15 matters such as grants. I am sure you realise anything medical should be discussed with the University Medical Service, which also has an excellent counselling centre. I think that was made clear yesterday. However the Union Q16 has its own officer who can give advice on legal problems. Now, onto Radford. For a town of its size, Radford has some unusually good leisure and community facilities and has quite a good shopping centre, with an interesting range of shops. As you go into Radford, there's a new . . . well, quite new .. . Olympic-size swimming pool. That's on the outskirts at a Example place called Renton. Above the pool there's a hi-tech fitness centre. Are there Q17 any ice skaters here? No? Oh, pity! The facilities for ice-skating are excellent. Well, the new Metro Tower, right in the centre of town has got an ice rink QI8 and a sports hall for squash, badminton, volleyball and several other indoor sports. And in the same building there's a new cinema with six screens. Er ... Q19 then, let me see, in the main square, just two minutes' walk from the Metro Q20 Tower, there's the Theatre Royal, which often gets London productions on tour... and in the streets nearby you can find a good range of inexpensive restaurants including Indian, Chinese, Thai and ...
SECTION 3
DR SIMON OK, welcome back to the new term. Hope you've had a good break and that you're looking forward to writing your dissertation ... What I'd like to do in this session is give you the opportunity to ask questions on writing the dissertation ... requirements, milestones ... who to see when you need help. It's very informal... it may all be written on paper, but it's nice to get it confirmed. So anything you'd like to ask? ANDY Dr Simon, is there a fixed hand-in date yet? DR SIMON Right. I can confirm that that's 21 May, not 20 as we first stated. OK? ... Q21 Jane? JANE What about the word limit? DR SIMON Well we try to be pretty flexible on this, but in broad terms it's 18-20,000. Q22
JANE Ah... DR SIMON And you can choose your topics ... anything from Years 2 and 3 ... Yes? JANE I still haven't got any idea what I want to do it on. Who .. . ? DR SIMON Well, you should see your course tutor to agree on your final title and you should also be aware that there's a special programme running on research Q23 methods for anyone who wants some extra help on that. JANE Can I just check on the deadlines for everything? DR SIMON Yes, sure. Look, let me write it on the board ... when the different stages have to be completed. First of all you've got to work on your basic bibliography, and that's due in to your course tutor by 31 January ... which is just two weeks away, so you'd better get a move on on that. ANDY Do we have to have our own draft plan by then?
DR SIMON No, your draft plan is due on 7 February, which is a week later, so that . Q24
should give you plenty of time. JANE And when do we have to be doing the research? Q25 DR SIMON That's over a one-month period . . . essentially February to March. ANDY And the write up? DR SIMON Well, you can't really get going on your writing until you've got quite a bit of Q26 the research done, so that's really March to May, with the hand in date on 21st. Any more questions?
ANDY Well, sir, just some advice really. It's about computers . .. would you advise us to buy one? DR SIMON What can 1 say, Andy? I know it's a massive expense, but I really feel that it Q27 will be of great benefit... you can always look in the Student Union adverts for second hand ones. Yes? JANE I've been looking at some of last year's dissertations. ANDY Is that a good idea, sir? I heard ... DR SIMON Well, I don't think you should read them in detail too early or you might end up taking more of their ideas than you realise. But yes ... it really is the best Q28 guide you can have to the expectations of the ... of what's expected when you write a dissertation. ANDY Sorry, Jane, I interrupted you. JANE That's OK. It's just that they did a lot of research using questionnaires ... is that a good idea? DR SIMON I think questionnaires are very good at telling you how people questionnaires, but to be frank they tell you very little else. Avoid them! Q29 ANDY About interviews ... is it OK if we interview you? DR SIMON The tutors? I don't see why not; they don't have any special contribution to Q30 make, but you can if you want. There's a whole section on this issue in the Research Guide. I'm afraid it's slightly out of date, and you're probably better talking to the tutor on the Research Methods course, but you might find it useful to start there. ANDY/JANE OK, thanks. DR SIMON OK ... well, great, I hope that sorted a few things out. You can always come and see me or drop me a note if you've got any more queries. ANDY/JANE Fine. DR SIMON OK. Thanks ...
SECTION 4
LECTURER Good morning. This morning we are continuing our look at Australia and its natural problems. Actually dryness, or aridity, as it is generally called by geographers, is probably the most challenging of Australia's natural problems and so it is very important in this course for you to have a good understanding of the subject. For
Australia, water is a precious resource and its wise management is of the greatest importance. As I have said, Australia is a dry continent, second only to Antarctica in its lack of Q31 rainfall. Long hours of hot sunshine and searing winds give Australia an extremely high rate of evaporation, far more than in most other countries. It is estimated that approximately 87% of Australia's rainfall is lost through evaporation, compared with just Q32 over 60% in Europe and Africa and 48% in North America. You generally think of Africa as being a very hot and dry place, but it is not in comparison with Australia. In many parts of Australia standing water, that is dams, puddles and so forth, dry up rapidly and some rainfall barely penetrates the soil. The reason for this is that the moisture is absorbed by Q33 thirsty plants. Some parts of Australia are dry because rainwater seeps quickly through sandy soils Q34 and into the rock below. In parts of Australia this water which seeps through the sandy soil collects underground to form underground lakes. Water from these subterranean lakes can be pumped to the surface and tapped and so used for various purposes above the ground. In fact, extensive underground water resources are available over more than half of Australia's land area, but most of the water is too salty to be used for human consumption or for the irrigation of crops. However, most inland farmers do rely on this Q35 water for watering their animals and, where possible, to a lesser extent for irrigation. Underground water can flow very large distances and can be kept in underground reservoirs for a very long time. Water from these underground reservoirs bubbles to the surface as springs in some parts of the country, and these rare sources of permanent water Q36 were vital to early explorers of inland Australia, and to other pioneers last century, who used the springs for survival. But in many places levels have fallen drastically through continuous use over the years. This has necessitated the pumping of the water to the surface. Remarkably, underground water sources in Australia supply about 18% of Q37 total water consumption. So you can see it is quite an important source of water in this dry land. So most of the consumption of water in Australia comes from water which is kept above ground. More than 300 dams regulate river flows around the country. The dams store water for a variety of functions, the rural irrigation of crops, without which many Q38 productive areas of the country would not be able to be farmed; the regulation of flooding, Q39 a serious problem which will be dealt with later in the course; and last but not least, the harnessing of the force of gravity for the generation of electricity. Q40 That is all we have time for this morning, but you will be able to do further study on this important area in the library. I have a handout here with references on the subject, so if you are interested, please come up to the desk and take a copy. Next week's lecture is a case study of an outback farm and ...

AGENT Good morning. MIC House Agency. PAUL Good morning. I'm ringing about the problems I've been having with my apartment. AGENT Yes, of course. If I can just take a few details first... What's your name? PAUL Paul Smiley. AGENT How do you spell that? PAUL S-M-I-L-E-Y. Example Repeat AGENT OK, and what's the address? PAUL Apartment 2, 16 Rose Lane. Q1 AGENT Rose Lane... and that's in ... ? PAUL In Newton. AGENT Oh yes, I know the property. Could I just ask how long is the lease? PAUL It's for one year. AGENT And you moved in ... ? PAUL Last week, on 27th June. Q2 AGENT Fine, thank you.
AGENT And what are the problems that you've been having? PAUL Well, no one thing is really dangerous or anything, but you know, it's just been building up. AGENT Yes, of course. PAUL Well the first thing is the washing machine. It's been leaking a little and it's beginning to get worse. Because we have a small child, we really need to get that Example done straight away. AGENT OK... that's a washing machine for immediate repair. PAUL And then there's a niggling problem with the cooker... AGENT Ah ha... PAUL The door's broken. Q3 AGENT Right. PAUL It's nothing serious and it can be used, but if you can send someone over in the Q4 next couple of weeks or so that'd be great. AGENT Fine, I've got that. PAUL Then we are worried about all the windows. AGENT Are they broken? PAUL No, but there are no locks on them ... and you know with the insurance these Q5 days... AGENT And when would you like those done?
PAUL Oh, that's not really urgent ... but you never know when there's going to be a
break-in... AGENT No, we'll get those done for you next week, don't worry. PAUL And then there's the bathroom light . . it's getting quite annoying. It flickers Q6 quite badly and it's giving me headaches. I'd really like to get that replaced right Q7 away. AGENT That's no problem. PAUL And then the last thing on the list is the kitchen curtains. They're torn. Q8 AGENT Oh, right. We do have quite a few spare ones in stock and can get those to you Q9 in the next week, if that's alright with you? PAUL Yes, that'd be fine. AGENT Anything else?
PAUL No, that's all. AGENT OK, fine. What we'll do is get someone over to you this afternoon, if you're in. PAUL Well, I'm going to be out for a short time. AGENT Well you tell us your preferred times. PAUL Well the best time is about 1.00. Q10 AGENT I'll have to check that with him. And if he can't make it then, what would be your second preference? PAUL Any time up to 5 pm would be fine. Q10 AGENT OK, I've made a note of that. PAUL Great, well thanks very much for your help. AGENT That's fine. Thank you for calling.
PAUL Goodbye.

RECREATION OFFICER Great. Well, hi, everyone! My name's Jody and I'm one of the four recreation officers here at Rainforest Lodge. My job is to make sure that you all have a great stay here with us and go away feeling relaxed and refreshed. As you can see, we're literally in the middle of nowhere at the Lodge. There are no newspapers or TVs and there's only one phone and Q11 that's in the office. The Lodge is a complete 'getaway from it all' experience: a place to unwind and appreciate the world without a lot of interruptions and distractions. From your cabin balcony you'll find that you can't see anyone else and the only noise you should hear is the birds. When the luggage comes, one of the guys will take it across to your cabin for you and make sure you know the way back here to the main centre for dinner in the restaurant. Dinner will be served in about an hour or so. Q12 All the times of each day's activities are printed on the blue sheet you should have got in the information guides that were handed out on the coach. Each Explorer trip has a different focus, so it doesn't matter how many you do or on what day, because there's always something new to discover in the rainforest. Tomorrow 1 think we've still got places on the Orchid and Fungi Tour. This is on foot
and takes you to different parts of the rainforest. Or, if you'd prefer, there's the Four- Q13 Wheel-Drive tour to the waterfalls, or the fishing trip where I promise you we'll catch some lunch, and last but not least, the famous Crocodile Cruise that leaves at 11 am each day. Q14 (Just in time for the crocodile's lunch!) Plenty to choose from here at Rainforest Lodge or just sit on your balcony, relax and unwind and enjoy the views. In the evenings there is the Spotlight Tour, one of my favourites. The Spotlight Tour leaves at sundown and lets you QI5 catch a glimpse of some more of the rainforest's wildlife as it comes out at dusk to feed. That's a great trip and if you can, I'd really try to make sure you do it during your stay.
You've chosen to visit the rainforest in March, which is just at the end of the wet season, so you'll soon notice how well the waterfalls are running and also how damp the ground is. Things can tend to get a bit slippery, too, so if you didn't bring any walking boots I'd Q16 advise you to hire some from the office. You'll also be much better off in long trousers Q17 rather than shorts because they will give your legs more protection, and socks are a good Q18 idea too. There's no need to be nervous of the rainforest provided that you treat it with respect and common sense. Most of the animals and wildlife are gentle and harmless. There are Q19 some venomous snakes to beware of, but really they're much more frightened of you than you are of them. The other thing is that certain plants can cause irritation if you touch Q20 them with bare skin. Well, that's about all for the time being. The guys are here to take you and your luggage to the cabins ...
SECTION 3
COUNSELLOR Hello, John, What can I do for you? JOHN Well, I heard about these counselling sessions from a friend doing a science course and I was really interested. I think they should be compulsory really. COUNSELLOR Well to be quite honest, John, I think they would be useful for everybody but well, everybody has their own way of going about things. I prefer Q21 people just to drop in when they can.
JOHN Yes. COUNSELLOR I find that talking to students about the requirements of a course helps to clarify what needs to be done. I mean the biggest difference between college and school is that new college students really have to do a lot of work on Q22 their own, and it's sometimes useful to get advice on how to take control of your time and work effectively. JOHN Yes. I mean, it seems like a very light workload until assignment time comes and then I seem to be working all night sometimes. I'm not the only one. It's ridiculous. The resource centre is very good but it closes so early. Q23 It's in the library and so you'd think you could use it more. It's a real problem for me. COUNSELLOR Well, you're certainly not the only person in that position, as I'm sure you've found. It really comes down to using every available hour in a
systematic way. If you do this with a plan, then you'll find that you still Q24 have time for yourself and your hobbies as well. JOHN Yeah. I've heard from Thomas that you made him a sort of plan like this, and he's going away for the weekend with all his work handed in, whereas I haven't even started. COUNSELLOR I need to find out a few more things about you first. I'll give you this form Q25 to fill in about your lectures and things before you leave.
COUNSELLOR Now, what are your main problems? JOHN Well, what most concerns me is I'm still not doing very well in my assignments. COUNSELLOR Well, I know that you plan your writing carefully, but this can come to nothing if the assignment doesn't answer the question. That really is the key. You must read the question carefully and give it a great deal of thought before you even start planning or writing your first draft. It's also Q26 vital to check your work for errors. Everybody makes them, and they can influence the person marking the work. So, always take time at the end to Q26 check what you have written. JOHN As far as listening is concerned, I find it hard to keep up sometimes in lectures, especially two-hour ones. I sometimes just seem to go off into a dream. COUNSELLOR It's a good idea to find out from your lecturers if they mind you recording Q27 the lectures. You only need one of those small cassette recorders. The quality is pretty good and a second listening can really clarify things. Something else you can do is check your notes with a friend after the Q28 lecture. JOHN Yes. That's a good idea. Thanks. It's hard to do all that all the time though, especially when there's so much reading to do. COUNSELLOR Yes. It's important, though, not to confine yourself to reading on your subject. You should also read things of general interest that appeal to you. Q29 You know, novels, newspapers, that kind of thing. Do you have a good Q30 dictionary? JOHN Not really. I've never bothered with one COUNSELLOR Mmmm. It would probably be a good idea to get one. Dictionaries are not Q30 expensive and they can help a lot. Also you can underline or highlight new words and ...
SECTION 4
TUTOR Well, good afternoon. In today's session John Upton will be sharing some of the findings of his research project from last term. John ... JOHN Thanks. Well, first of all, a little bit about the background to the project. Our title, as you can see, is pretty straightforward: 'car safety'. But these days there's a lot more to it than the usual injunctions about drinking and driving or speeding.
I had been interested and horrified by several newspaper reports on what people Q31 call 'road rage'. For example the famous incident of a man getting out of his car in a car park and hitting the driver of a van who had overtaken him earlier. It seemed to me that there were almost as many serious problems when cars were parked ... i.e. were stationary ... as when they were travelling at 90 miles an hour. So I decided to make this the focus of the project. For our research we depended mainly on talking to individuals, asking them Q32 questions rather than using written questionnaires. We stopped people at a selected garage on the motorway over a two-day period, and asked them questions about what they'd observed or experienced themselves. Our respondents were both men and women, but the women were just slightly in the Q33 majority. We were pleased by the public's willingness to stop and chat to us ... in the end we talked to a total of 135 drivers over those two days. Q34 So what were our findings? Well, as you can see, 93% of respondents had had some kind of problem. A surprisingly large percentage - 24% had had their car damaged in some way, but the main type of incident was being shouted Q35 at - 79% had experienced that. 15% had experienced violence on their own persons ... they'd actually been hit by someone. The police tended only to be informed when there was physical violence involved. So what strategies had people developed to ensure their own safety? Let's have a look at the figures here. Well, first of all, it was quite striking that there were often distinct answers from the men and women. It was mainly women, for example, Example who said one shouldn't ever stop to find out how to get somewhere. Whereas it was men who said you should try to avoid looking directly at other drivers. Both Q36 men and ... oh sorry no... it was women who said you had to tell someone Q37 when you were due to get to a particular destination. Then, I had thought that it would be mainly men, but both sexes made the point that it's much safer to get Q38 keys out well in advance as you go towards your car. Men were very aware that muggers or whatever might be concealed behind the car. They also made the Q39 point that you should leave plenty of room when you park your car so you can make a quick getaway if you need to. Finally, locking doors at all times ... men didn't think it was quite as important as women, but both gave it a high safety Q40 rating. When we asked them what they thought the best improvements had been in the last five years in helping with road rage problems ...

The chart shows that the percentage of British households with a range of consumer durables steadily increased between 1972 and 1983. The greatest increase was in telephone ownership, rising from 42% in 1972 to 77% in 1983. Next came centralheating ownership, rising from 37% of households in 1972 to 64% in 1983. The percentage of households with a refrigerator rose 21% over the same period and of those with a washing machine by 14%. Households with vacuum-cleaners. televisions and dishwashers increased by 8%, 5% and 2% respectively. In 1983. the year of their introduction, 18% of households had a video recorder.
The significant social changes reflected in the statistics are that over the period the proportion of British houses with central heating rose from one to two thuds, and of those with a phone from under a half to over three-quarters. Together with the big increases in the ownership of washing machines and refrigerators, they are evidence of both rising living standards and the trend to lifestyles based on comfort and convenience.

believe that child-rearing should be the responsibility of both parents and that, | whilst the roles within that partnership may be different, they are nevertheless equal in importance. In some societies, it has been made easier over the years for single parents to raise children on their own. However, this does not mean that the traditional family, with both parents providing emotional support and role-models for their children, is not the most satisfactory way of bringing up children.
Of crucial importance, in my opinion, is how we define 'responsible for bringing the children up'. At its simplest, it could mean giving the financial support necessary to provide a home, food and clothes and making sure the child is safe and receives an adequate education. This would be the basic definition.
There is, however, another possible way of defining that part of the quotation. That would say it is not just the fathers responsibility to provide the basics for his children, ; while his wife involves herself in the everyday activity of bringing them up. Rather, he should share those daily duties, spend as much time as his job allows with his children, play with them, read to them, help directly with their education, participate very fully in their lives and encourage them to share his.
It is this second, fuller, concept of 'fatherhood' that I am in favour of, although I also realise how difficult it is to achieve sometimes. The economic and employment situation in many countries means that jobs are getting more, not less, stressful, requiring long hours and perhaps long journeys to work as well. Therefore it may remain for many a desirable ideal rather than an achievable reality. ,

The chart shows the number of hours of leisure enjoyed by men and women in a typical week in 1998-9, according to gender and employment status.
Among those employed full-time, men on average had fifty hours of leisure, whereas women had approximately thirty-seven hours. There were no figures given for male part-time workers, but female part-timers had forty hours of leisure time, only slightly more than women in full-time employment, perhaps reflecting their work in the home.
In the unemployed and retired categories, leisure time showed an increase for both sexes, as might have been expected. Here too, men enjoyed more leisure time over eighty hours, compared with seventy hours for women, perhaps once again reflecting the fact that women spend more time working in the home than men.
Lastly, housewives enjoyed approximately fifty-four hours of leisure, on average. There were no figures given for househusbands! Overall, the chart demonstrates that in the categories for which statistics on male leisure time were available, men • enjoyed at least ten hours of extra leisure time.

Of course it goes without saying that prevention is better than cure. That is why, in recent years, there has been a growing body of opinion in favour of putting more resources into health education and preventive measures. The argument is that ignorance of, for example, basic hygiene or the dangers of an unhealthy diet or lifestyle needs to be combatted by special nationwide publicity campaigns, as well as longer-term health education.
Obviously,there is a strong human argument for catching any medical condition as early as possible. There is also an economic argument for doing so. Statistics demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of treating a condition in the early stages, rather than delaying until more expensive and prolonged treatment is necessary. Then there are social or economic costs, perhaps in terms of loss of earnings for the family concerned or unemployed benefit paid by the state.
So far so good, but the difficulties start when we try to define what the 'proportion' of the budget "should be, particularly if the funds will be 'diverted from treatment'. Decisions on exactly how much of the total health budget should be spent in this way ' are not a matter for the non-specialist, but should be made on the basis of an accepted health service model.
This is the point at which real problems occur - the formulation of the model. How do we accurately measure which health education campaigns are effective in both medical and financial terms? How do we agree about the medical efficacy of various screening programmes, for example, when the medical establishment itself does not agree? A very rigorous process of evaluation is called for, so that we can make informed decisions.

According to statistical Information, the main reason for traveling abroad is holidays, business, and visits to friends and relatives. Indeed, there is a steady increase in the number of holiday makers; while in 1996 there were about 17,896 of the sample in 1998 there were 20,700 of them. Moreover, with the Introduction of more countries within the EC market, travelling for business has also increased. Although there is not a big decrement 3,957 traveled abroad for business during \998> compared with 3,249 in 1996. Finally, traveling abroad for visiting friends and relatives shows a steady Increase over the period 1994—1998. While there were about 2,628 travelers in 1995 in 1998 the number increased to 3,181 in 1998. Consequently, there is a steady increase in three main reasons for travelling abroad; Holidays, business, or to visit relatives and friends.
In addition, there is also an Increased change in the destinations which people tend to prefer for travelling. The area which appear to be more popular among travellers is Western Europe. Indeed, while in 1994 only 19,371 of the sample preferred to spend their holiday (or other reasons) in that main region, there was an increase to 24,519 in 1998. North America and other areas appeared also favourable. In 1996, there were 1,167 going to North America and 1,905 to other areas. These numbers increased to 1,823 and 2,486 accordingly. Statistical figures prove that Western Europe seems to be the most favourable place for holiday makers while North America and other areas follow behind.

A wide range of structures and vocabulary are used appropriately and accurately with only minor flaws.
Before talking about the essential role of death penalty, you have to think about the meaning, and the purpose, of any kind of punishment. If you consider that the purpose is to prevent the guilty from being nasty again, you can be seduced by an argumentation in favour of the suppression of capital punishment. But you have to think about another aspect of the problem: a punishment is also useful to impress people, to make them fear the law. In fact, let's take the example of a young misfit, which has grown in a violent atmosphere, influenced by older delinquents, etc... He lives in the streets, he's got no aim but to survive. This is the kind of person who could possibly kill someone for money, or even for fun... Why would he fear prison? Life would be easier for him there. In addition, in many cases, when you behave normally, you can benefit from penalty reductions. This young misfit needs to be impressed, he needs to know that the law is a frontier. When you cross it, you can lose your life. That is why capital punishment helps keeping a distance between robbery and murder. If you abolish it, you suppress the difference between these two types of crime, which are completely different.
But there is also a limit to define: even if death penalty is unavoidable, it would be a crime to apply it to inadequate cases. If there is no premeditation or past facts which can justify such a punishment, it is far too strict to apply death penalty. That is why the lawmakers have to establish precisely the context in which capital punishment car be pronounced. That is the price to pay to limit violence without using excessive violence...

The table shows that the figures for imprisonment in the five countries mentioned indicate no overall pattern of increase or decrease. In fact there is considerable fluctuation from country to country.
In Great Britain the numbers in prison have increased steadily from 30 000 in 1930 to 80,000 in 1980. On the other hand in Australia, and particularly in New Zealand the numbers fell markedly from 1930 to 1940. Since then they have increased gradually, apart from in 1980 when the numbers in prison in New Zealand fell by about 30,000 from the 1970 total. Canada is the only country in which the numbers in prison have decreased over the period 1930 to 1980, although there have been fluctuations in this trend. The figures for the United States indicate the greatest number of prisoners compared to the other four countries but population size needs to be taken into account in this analysis. The prison population in the United States increased rapidly from 1970 to 1980 and this must be a worrying trend.

It is certainly true that the position of women in society has undergone a dramatic change in the past twenty years but I do not feel that this is a direct cause of the indisputable increase in juvenile-related problems during this period.
It is now accepted that young women should find work on leaving school; indeed to rely totally on their parents' financial support is no longer an option in many families. Likewise, once they get married, the majority of women continue working since the financial pressures of setting up a house and establishing a reasonable standard of living often require two incomes.
Twenty years ago it was common for women to give up work once they had children and devote their time to caring for their children. This is no longer the general rule and the provision of professionally-run child care facilities and day nurseries have removed much of the responsibility for child rearing that used to fall to mothers. However, these facilities come at a cost and often require two salaries coming into a family to be afforded.
I do not believe that the increase in the number of working mothers has resulted in children being brought up less well than previously. Indeed it could be argued that by giving mothers the opportunity to work and earn extra money children can be better provided for than previously. There is more money for luxuries and holidays and a more secure family life is possible. Of course there are limits as to the amount of time that ideally should be spent away from home and the ideal scenario would be for one of the parents (often the wife) to have a part-time job and thus be available for their children before and after school. It is important to establish the correct balance between family life and working life.

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am writing this letter to explain why I have been unable to return the three books have out on three-day loan, which are now overdue. After taking the books out on 16th March, I had an urgent phone call from my elderly aunt's neighbour to say that my aunt had had a fall and had been taken into hospital. I am her only surviving relative in this country, so I felt I had to go and see her immediately. I travelled down to Surrey the following morning, thinking I would stay for only two or three days. Unfortunately, my aunt's condition has only improved very slowly, so I have had to stay here longer than expected. However, the hospital says that if all goes well, she should be able to go home in two or three days' time, in which case I will be back at the beginning of next week.
Dealing in mind the circumstances I trust you will kindly waive any fines that may have accumulated.
Yours sincerely

It is certainly very understandable that some governments should start looking at ways of limiting their populations to a sustainable figure. In the past, populations were partly regulated by frequent war and widespread disease, but in recent years the effects of those factors have been diminished. Countries can be faced with a population that is growing much faster than she nation's food resources or employment opportunities and whose members can be condemned to poverty by the need to feed extra mouths. They identify population control as a'means to raising living standards.
But how should it be achieved? Clearly, this whole area is a very delicate personal and cultural issue. Many people feel that this is not a matter for the state. They feel this is one area of life where they have the right to make decisions for themselves. For that reason, it would seem that the best. approach would be to work by persuasion rather than compulsion This could be done by a process of education that points out the way a smaller family can mean an improved quality of life for the family members, as well as less strain on the country's perhaps very limited, resources.
This is the preferred way. Of course if this docs not succeed within a reasonable time scale, it may be necessary to consider other measures. such as tax incentives or child-benefit payments for small families only. These are midway between persuasion and compulsion
So. yes. it is sometimes necessary, but governments should try very hard to persuade first. They should also remember that this is a very delicate area indeed, and that social engineering can create as many problems as it solves?

I am not surprise when I read in the newspapers that many people move to English speaking countries. I am an engineer in a process control since ten years and I understand the necessity of English language. For example, when I read technical English specifications, when I meet Japanese Industrials to build together some electronic materials or when I go on holidays in Italy where the best way (for me) to communicate is to speak English. Therefore, today, it's necessary to learn English and the best way is to study in English as soon as possible when we are at school but also when we have a job. It's so Important to communicate with foreigners, because of work. For example: to seafoods in USA, to build electronic cards with the Japanese, to obtain a certification with FDA (American organization) in order to sell some pharmaceutical products. In fact, jt's Important for everybody, the workers, the visitors, the scientists, etc ...
These are the main reason which explain why so many people go to English speaking countries (the best way to learn) and why English is such an Important International language (the communication between many the people over the world.

Test 1

Adults and children are frequently confronted with statements about the alarming rate of loss of tropical rainforests. For example, one graphic illustration to which children might readily relate is the estimate that rainforests are being destroyed at a rate equivalent to one thousand football fields every forty minutes – about the duration of a normal classroom period. In the face of the frequent and often vivid media coverage, it is likely that children will have formed ideas about rainforests – what and where they are, why they are important, what endangers them – independent of any formal tuition. It is also possible that some of these ideas will be mistaken. Many studies have shown that children harbour misconceptions about ‘pure’, curriculum science. These misconceptions do not remain isolated but become incorporated into a multifaceted, but organised, conceptual framework, making it and the component ideas, some of which are erroneous, more robust but also accessible to modification. These ideas may be developed by children absorbing ideas through the popular media. Sometimes this information may be erroneous. It seems schools may not be providing an opportunity for children to re-express their ideas and so have them tested and refined by teachers and their peers. Despite the extensive coverage in the popular media of the destruction of rainforests, little formal information is available about children’s ideas in this area. The aim of the present study is to start to provide such information, to help teachers design their educational strategies to build upon correct ideas and to displace misconceptions and to plan programmes in environmental studies in their schools. The study surveys children’s scientific knowledge and attitudes to rainforests. Secondary school children were asked to complete a questionnaire containing five open-form questions. The most frequent responses to the first question were descriptions which are self-evident from the term ‘rainforest’. Some children described them as damp, wet or hot. The second question concerned the geographical location of rainforests. The commonest responses were continents or countries: Africa (given by 43% of children), South America (30%), Brazil (25%). Some children also gave more general locations, such as being near the Equator.

Responses to question three concerned the importance of rainforests. The dominant idea, raised by 64% of the pupils, was that rainforests provide animals with habitats. Fewer students responded that rainforests provide plant habitats, and even fewer mentioned the indigenous populations of rainforests. More girls (70%) than boys (60%) raised the idea of rainforest as animal habitats. Similarly, but at a lower level, more girls (13%) than boys (5%) said that rainforests provided human habitats. These observations are generally consistent with our previous studies of pupils’ views about the use and conservation of rainforests, in which girls were shown to be more sympathetic to animals and expressed views which seem to place an intrinsic value on non-human animal life. The fourth question concerned the causes of the destruction of rainforests. Perhaps encouragingly, more than half of the pupils (59%) identified that it is human activities which are destroying rainforests, some personalising the responsibility by the use of terms such as ‘we are’. About 18% of the pupils referred specifically to logging activity. One misconception, expressed by some 10% of the pupils, was that acid rain is responsible for rainforest destruction; a similar proportion said that pollution is destroying rainforests. Here, children are confusing rainforest destruction with damage to the forests of Western Europe by these factors. While two fifths of the students provided the information that the rainforests provide oxygen, in some cases this response also embraced the misconception that rainforest destruction would reduce atmospheric oxygen, making the atmosphere incompatible with human life on Earth. In answer to the final question about the importance of rainforest conservation, the majority of children simply said that we need rainforests to survive. Only a few of the pupils (6%) mentioned that rainforest destruction may contribute to global warming. This is surprising considering the high level of media coverage on this issue. Some children expressed the idea that the conservation of rainforests is not important. The results of this study suggest that certain ideas predominate in the thinking of children about rainforests. Pupils’ responses indicate some misconceptions in basic scientific knowledge of rainforests’ ecosystems such as their ideas about rainforests as habitats for animals, plants and humans and the relationship between climatic change and destruction of rainforests. Pupils did not volunteer ideas that suggested that they appreciated the complexity of causes of rainforest destruction. In other words, they gave no indication of an appreciation of either the range of ways in which rainforests are important or the complex social, economic and political factors which drive the activities which are destroying the rainforests. One encouragement is that the results of similar studies about other environmental issues suggest that older children seem to acquire the ability to appreciate, value and evaluate conflicting views. Environmental education offers an arena in which these skills can be developed, which is essential for these children as future decision-makers.

W Wh ha at t D Do o W Wh ha al le es s F Fe ee el l? ? An examination of the functioning of the senses in cetaceans, the group of mammals comprising whales, dolphins and porpoises
Some of the senses that we and other terrestrial mammals take for granted are either reduced or absent in cetaceans or fail to function well in water. For example, it appears from their brain structure that toothed species are unable to smell. Baleen species, on the other hand, appear to have some related brain structures but it is not known whether these are functional. It has been speculated that, as the blowholes evolved and migrated to the top of the head, the neural pathways serving sense of smell may have been nearly all sacriﬁced. Similarly, although at least some cetaceans have taste buds, the nerves serving these have degenerated or are rudimentary.
The sense of touch has sometimes been described as weak too, but this view is probably mistaken. Trainers of captive dolphins and small whales often remark on their animals’ responsiveness to being touched or rubbed, and both captive and freeranging cetacean individuals of all species (particularly adults and calves, or members of the same subgroup) appear to make frequent contact. This contact may help to maintain order within a group, and stroking or touching are part of the courtship ritual in most species. The area around the blowhole is also particularly sensitive and captive animals often object strongly to being touched there.
Test 1
24
The sense of vision is developed to different degrees in different species. Baleen species studied at close quarters underwater – speciﬁcally a grey whale calf in captivity for a year, and free-ranging right whales and humpback whales studied and ﬁlmed off Argentina and Hawaii – have obviously tracked objects with vision underwater, and they can apparently see moderately well both in water and in air. However, the position of the eyes so restricts the ﬁeld of vision in baleen whales that they probably do not have stereoscopic vision.
On the other hand, the position of the eyes in most dolphins and porpoises suggests that they have stereoscopic vision forward and downward. Eye position in freshwater dolphins, which often swim on their side or upside down while feeding, suggests that what vision they have is stereoscopic forward and upward. By comparison, the bottlenose dolphin has extremely keen vision in water. Judging from the way it watches and tracks airborne ﬂying ﬁsh, it can apparently see fairly well through the air–water interface as well. And although preliminary experimental evidence suggests that their in-air vision is poor, the accuracy with which dolphins leap high to take small ﬁsh out of a trainer’s hand provides anecdotal evidence to the contrary.
Such variation can no doubt be explained with reference to the habitats in which individual species have developed. For example, vision is obviously more useful to species inhabiting clear open waters than to those living in turbid rivers and ﬂooded plains. The South American boutu and Chinese beiji, for instance, appear to have very limited vision, and the Indian susus are blind, their eyes reduced to slits that probably allow them to sense only the direction and intensity of light.
Although the senses of taste and smell appear to have deteriorated, and vision in water appears to be uncertain, such weaknesses are more than compensated for by cetaceans’ well-developed acoustic sense. Most species are highly vocal, although they vary in the range of sounds they produce, and many forage for food using echolocation1. Large baleen whales primarily use the lower frequencies and are often limited in their repertoire. Notable exceptions are the nearly song-like choruses of bowhead whales in summer and the complex, haunting utterances of the humpback whales. Toothed species in general employ more of the frequency spectrum, and produce a wider variety of sounds, than baleen species (though the sperm whale apparently produces a monotonous series of high-energy clicks and little else). Some of the more complicated sounds are clearly communicative, although what role they may play in the social life and ‘culture’ of cetaceans has been more the subject of wild speculation than of solid science.

Visual Symbols and the Blind
Part 1 From a number of recent studies, it has become clear that blind people can appreciate the use of outlines and perspectives to describe the arrangement of objects and other surfaces in space. But pictures are more than literal representations. This fact was drawn to my attention dramatically when a blind woman in one of my investigations decided on her own initiative to draw a wheel as it was spinning. To show this motion, she traced a curve inside the circle (Fig. 1). I was taken aback. Lines of motion, such as the one she used, are a very recent invention in the history of illustration. Indeed, as art scholar David Kunzle notes, Wilhelm Busch, a trend-setting nineteenth-century cartoonist, used virtually no motion lines in his popular ﬁgures until about 1877.
When I asked several other blind study subjects to draw a spinning wheel, one particularly clever rendition appeared repeatedly: several subjects showed the wheel’s spokes as curved lines. When asked about these curves, they all described them as metaphorical ways of suggesting motion. Majority rule would argue that this device somehow indicated motion very well. But was it a better indicator than, say, broken or wavy lines – or any other kind of line, for that matter? The answer was not clear. So I decided to test whether various lines of motion were apt ways of showing movement or if they were merely idiosyncratic marks. Moreover, I wanted to discover whether there were differences in how the blind and the sighted interpreted lines of motion.
To search out these answers, I created raised-line drawings of ﬁve different wheels, depicting spokes with lines that curved, bent, waved, dashed and extended beyond the perimeter of the wheel. I then asked eighteen blind volunteers to feel the wheels and assign one of the following motions to each wheel: wobbling, spinning fast, spinning steadily, jerking or braking. My control group consisted of eighteen sighted undergraduates from the University of Toronto.
All but one of the blind subjects assigned distinctive motions to each wheel. Most guessed that the curved spokes indicated that the wheel was spinning steadily; the wavy spokes, they thought, suggested that the wheel was wobbling; and the bent spokes were taken as a sign that the wheel was jerking. Subjects assumed that spokes extending beyond the wheel’s perimeter signiﬁed that the wheel had its brakes on and that dashed spokes indicated the wheel was spinning quickly.

In addition, the favoured description for the sighted was the favoured description for the blind in every instance. What is more, the consensus among the sighted was barely higher than that among the blind. Because motion devices are unfamiliar to the blind, the task I gave them involved some problem solving. Evidently, however, the blind not only ﬁgured out meanings for each line of motion, but as a group they generally came up with the same meaning at least as frequently as did sighted subjects.
Part 2 We have found that the blind understand other kinds of visual metaphors as well. One blind woman drew a picture of a child inside a heart – choosing that symbol, she said, to show that love surrounded the child. With Chang Hong Liu, a doctoral student from China, I have begun exploring how well blind people understand the symbolism behind shapes such as hearts that do not directly represent their meaning.
We gave a list of twenty pairs of words to sighted subjects and asked them to pick from each pair the term that best related to a circle and the term that best related to a square. For example, we asked: What goes with soft? A circle or a square? Which shape goes with hard?
All our subjects deemed the circle soft and the square hard. A full 94% ascribed happy to the circle, instead of sad. But other pairs revealed less agreement: 79% matched fast to slow and weak to strong, respectively. And only 51% linked deep to circle and shallow to square. (See Fig. 2.) When we tested four totally blind volunteers using the same list, we found that their choices closely resembled those made by the sighted subjects. One man, who had been blind since birth, scored extremely well. He made only one match differing from the consensus, assigning ‘far’ to square and ‘near’ to circle. In fact, only a small majority of sighted subjects – 53% – had paired far and near to the opposite partners. Thus, we concluded that the blind interpret abstract shapes as sighted people do.

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1–14 which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.
Test 1

Adults and children are frequently confronted with statements about the alarming rate of loss of tropical rainforests. For example, one graphic illustration to which children might readily relate is the estimate that rainforests are being destroyed at a rate equivalent to one thousand football fields every forty minutes – about the duration of a normal classroom period. In the face of the frequent and often vivid media coverage, it is likely that children will have formed ideas about rainforests – what and where they are, why they are important, what endangers them – independent of any formal tuition. It is also possible that some of these ideas will be mistaken. Many studies have shown that children harbour misconceptions about ‘pure’, curriculum science. These misconceptions do not remain isolated but become incorporated into a multifaceted, but organised, conceptual framework, making it and the component ideas, some of which are erroneous, more robust but also accessible to modification. These ideas may be developed by children absorbing ideas through the popular media. Sometimes this information may be erroneous. It seems schools may not be providing an opportunity for children to re-express their ideas and so have them tested and refined by teachers and their peers. Despite the extensive coverage in the popular media of the destruction of rainforests, little formal information is available about children’s ideas in this area. The aim of the present study is to start to provide such information, to help teachers design their educational strategies to build upon correct ideas and to displace misconceptions and to plan programmes in environmental studies in their schools. The study surveys children’s scientific knowledge and attitudes to rainforests. Secondary school children were asked to complete a questionnaire containing five open-form questions. The most frequent responses to the first question were descriptions which are self-evident from the term ‘rainforest’. Some children described them as damp, wet or hot. The second question concerned the geographical location of rainforests. The commonest responses were continents or countries: Africa (given by 43% of children), South America (30%), Brazil (25%). Some children also gave more general locations, such as being near the Equator.

Responses to question three concerned the importance of rainforests. The dominant idea, raised by 64% of the pupils, was that rainforests provide animals with habitats. Fewer students responded that rainforests provide plant habitats, and even fewer mentioned the indigenous populations of rainforests. More girls (70%) than boys (60%) raised the idea of rainforest as animal habitats. Similarly, but at a lower level, more girls (13%) than boys (5%) said that rainforests provided human habitats. These observations are generally consistent with our previous studies of pupils’ views about the use and conservation of rainforests, in which girls were shown to be more sympathetic to animals and expressed views which seem to place an intrinsic value on non-human animal life. The fourth question concerned the causes of the destruction of rainforests. Perhaps encouragingly, more than half of the pupils (59%) identified that it is human activities which are destroying rainforests, some personalising the responsibility by the use of terms such as ‘we are’. About 18% of the pupils referred specifically to logging activity. One misconception, expressed by some 10% of the pupils, was that acid rain is responsible for rainforest destruction; a similar proportion said that pollution is destroying rainforests. Here, children are confusing rainforest destruction with damage to the forests of Western Europe by these factors. While two fifths of the students provided the information that the rainforests provide oxygen, in some cases this response also embraced the misconception that rainforest destruction would reduce atmospheric oxygen, making the atmosphere incompatible with human life on Earth. In answer to the final question about the importance of rainforest conservation, the majority of children simply said that we need rainforests to survive. Only a few of the pupils (6%) mentioned that rainforest destruction may contribute to global warming. This is surprising considering the high level of media coverage on this issue. Some children expressed the idea that the conservation of rainforests is not important. The results of this study suggest that certain ideas predominate in the thinking of children about rainforests. Pupils’ responses indicate some misconceptions in basic scientific knowledge of rainforests’ ecosystems such as their ideas about rainforests as habitats for animals, plants and humans and the relationship between climatic change and destruction of rainforests. Pupils did not volunteer ideas that suggested that they appreciated the complexity of causes of rainforest destruction. In other words, they gave no indication of an appreciation of either the range of ways in which rainforests are important or the complex social, economic and political factors which drive the activities which are destroying the rainforests. One encouragement is that the results of similar studies about other environmental issues suggest that older children seem to acquire the ability to appreciate, value and evaluate conflicting views. Environmental education offers an arena in which these skills can be developed, which is essential for these children as future decision-makers.

W Wh ha at t D Do o W Wh ha al le es s F Fe ee el l? ? An examination of the functioning of the senses in cetaceans, the group of mammals comprising whales, dolphins and porpoises
Some of the senses that we and other terrestrial mammals take for granted are either reduced or absent in cetaceans or fail to function well in water. For example, it appears from their brain structure that toothed species are unable to smell. Baleen species, on the other hand, appear to have some related brain structures but it is not known whether these are functional. It has been speculated that, as the blowholes evolved and migrated to the top of the head, the neural pathways serving sense of smell may have been nearly all sacriﬁced. Similarly, although at least some cetaceans have taste buds, the nerves serving these have degenerated or are rudimentary.
The sense of touch has sometimes been described as weak too, but this view is probably mistaken. Trainers of captive dolphins and small whales often remark on their animals’ responsiveness to being touched or rubbed, and both captive and freeranging cetacean individuals of all species (particularly adults and calves, or members of the same subgroup) appear to make frequent contact. This contact may help to maintain order within a group, and stroking or touching are part of the courtship ritual in most species. The area around the blowhole is also particularly sensitive and captive animals often object strongly to being touched there.
Test 1
24
The sense of vision is developed to different degrees in different species. Baleen species studied at close quarters underwater – speciﬁcally a grey whale calf in captivity for a year, and free-ranging right whales and humpback whales studied and ﬁlmed off Argentina and Hawaii – have obviously tracked objects with vision underwater, and they can apparently see moderately well both in water and in air. However, the position of the eyes so restricts the ﬁeld of vision in baleen whales that they probably do not have stereoscopic vision.
On the other hand, the position of the eyes in most dolphins and porpoises suggests that they have stereoscopic vision forward and downward. Eye position in freshwater dolphins, which often swim on their side or upside down while feeding, suggests that what vision they have is stereoscopic forward and upward. By comparison, the bottlenose dolphin has extremely keen vision in water. Judging from the way it watches and tracks airborne ﬂying ﬁsh, it can apparently see fairly well through the air–water interface as well. And although preliminary experimental evidence suggests that their in-air vision is poor, the accuracy with which dolphins leap high to take small ﬁsh out of a trainer’s hand provides anecdotal evidence to the contrary.
Such variation can no doubt be explained with reference to the habitats in which individual species have developed. For example, vision is obviously more useful to species inhabiting clear open waters than to those living in turbid rivers and ﬂooded plains. The South American boutu and Chinese beiji, for instance, appear to have very limited vision, and the Indian susus are blind, their eyes reduced to slits that probably allow them to sense only the direction and intensity of light.
Although the senses of taste and smell appear to have deteriorated, and vision in water appears to be uncertain, such weaknesses are more than compensated for by cetaceans’ well-developed acoustic sense. Most species are highly vocal, although they vary in the range of sounds they produce, and many forage for food using echolocation1. Large baleen whales primarily use the lower frequencies and are often limited in their repertoire. Notable exceptions are the nearly song-like choruses of bowhead whales in summer and the complex, haunting utterances of the humpback whales. Toothed species in general employ more of the frequency spectrum, and produce a wider variety of sounds, than baleen species (though the sperm whale apparently produces a monotonous series of high-energy clicks and little else). Some of the more complicated sounds are clearly communicative, although what role they may play in the social life and ‘culture’ of cetaceans has been more the subject of wild speculation than of solid science.

Visual Symbols and the Blind
Part 1 From a number of recent studies, it has become clear that blind people can appreciate the use of outlines and perspectives to describe the arrangement of objects and other surfaces in space. But pictures are more than literal representations. This fact was drawn to my attention dramatically when a blind woman in one of my investigations decided on her own initiative to draw a wheel as it was spinning. To show this motion, she traced a curve inside the circle (Fig. 1). I was taken aback. Lines of motion, such as the one she used, are a very recent invention in the history of illustration. Indeed, as art scholar David Kunzle notes, Wilhelm Busch, a trend-setting nineteenth-century cartoonist, used virtually no motion lines in his popular ﬁgures until about 1877.
When I asked several other blind study subjects to draw a spinning wheel, one particularly clever rendition appeared repeatedly: several subjects showed the wheel’s spokes as curved lines. When asked about these curves, they all described them as metaphorical ways of suggesting motion. Majority rule would argue that this device somehow indicated motion very well. But was it a better indicator than, say, broken or wavy lines – or any other kind of line, for that matter? The answer was not clear. So I decided to test whether various lines of motion were apt ways of showing movement or if they were merely idiosyncratic marks. Moreover, I wanted to discover whether there were differences in how the blind and the sighted interpreted lines of motion.
To search out these answers, I created raised-line drawings of ﬁve different wheels, depicting spokes with lines that curved, bent, waved, dashed and extended beyond the perimeter of the wheel. I then asked eighteen blind volunteers to feel the wheels and assign one of the following motions to each wheel: wobbling, spinning fast, spinning steadily, jerking or braking. My control group consisted of eighteen sighted undergraduates from the University of Toronto.
All but one of the blind subjects assigned distinctive motions to each wheel. Most guessed that the curved spokes indicated that the wheel was spinning steadily; the wavy spokes, they thought, suggested that the wheel was wobbling; and the bent spokes were taken as a sign that the wheel was jerking. Subjects assumed that spokes extending beyond the wheel’s perimeter signiﬁed that the wheel had its brakes on and that dashed spokes indicated the wheel was spinning quickly.

Test 1
28
In addition, the favoured description for the sighted was the favoured description for the blind in every instance. What is more, the consensus among the sighted was barely higher than that among the blind. Because motion devices are unfamiliar to the blind, the task I gave them involved some problem solving. Evidently, however, the blind not only ﬁgured out meanings for each line of motion, but as a group they generally came up with the same meaning at least as frequently as did sighted subjects.
Part 2 We have found that the blind understand other kinds of visual metaphors as well. One blind woman drew a picture of a child inside a heart – choosing that symbol, she said, to show that love surrounded the child. With Chang Hong Liu, a doctoral student from China, I have begun exploring how well blind people understand the symbolism behind shapes such as hearts that do not directly represent their meaning.
We gave a list of twenty pairs of words to sighted subjects and asked them to pick from each pair the term that best related to a circle and the term that best related to a square. For example, we asked: What goes with soft? A circle or a square? Which shape goes with hard?
All our subjects deemed the circle soft and the square hard. A full 94% ascribed happy to the circle, instead of sad. But other pairs revealed less agreement: 79% matched fast to slow and weak to strong, respectively. And only 51% linked deep to circle and shallow to square. (See Fig. 2.) When we tested four totally blind volunteers using the same list, we found that their choices closely resembled those made by the sighted subjects. One man, who had been blind since birth, scored extremely well. He made only one match differing from the consensus, assigning ‘far’ to square and ‘near’ to circle. In fact, only a small majority of sighted subjects – 53% – had paired far and near to the opposite partners. Thus, we concluded that the blind interpret abstract shapes as sighted people do.

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1–14 which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.
Test 1
18
Adults and children are frequently confronted with statements about the alarming rate of loss of tropical rainforests. For example, one graphic illustration to which children might readily relate is the estimate that rainforests are being destroyed at a rate equivalent to one thousand football fields every forty minutes – about the duration of a normal classroom period. In the face of the frequent and often vivid media coverage, it is likely that children will have formed ideas about rainforests – what and where they are, why they are important, what endangers them – independent of any formal tuition. It is also possible that some of these ideas will be mistaken. Many studies have shown that children harbour misconceptions about ‘pure’, curriculum science. These misconceptions do not remain isolated but become incorporated into a multifaceted, but organised, conceptual framework, making it and the component ideas, some of which are erroneous, more robust but also accessible to modification. These ideas may be developed by children absorbing ideas through the popular media. Sometimes this information may be erroneous. It seems schools may not be providing an opportunity for children to re-express their ideas and so have them tested and refined by teachers and their peers. Despite the extensive coverage in the popular media of the destruction of rainforests, little formal information is available about children’s ideas in this area. The aim of the present study is to start to provide such information, to help teachers design their educational strategies to build upon correct ideas and to displace misconceptions and to plan programmes in environmental studies in their schools. The study surveys children’s scientific knowledge and attitudes to rainforests. Secondary school children were asked to complete a questionnaire containing five open-form questions. The most frequent responses to the first question were descriptions which are self-evident from the term ‘rainforest’. Some children described them as damp, wet or hot. The second question concerned the geographical location of rainforests. The commonest responses were continents or countries: Africa (given by 43% of children), South America (30%), Brazil (25%). Some children also gave more general locations, such as being near the Equator.

Responses to question three concerned the importance of rainforests. The dominant idea, raised by 64% of the pupils, was that rainforests provide animals with habitats. Fewer students responded that rainforests provide plant habitats, and even fewer mentioned the indigenous populations of rainforests. More girls (70%) than boys (60%) raised the idea of rainforest as animal habitats. Similarly, but at a lower level, more girls (13%) than boys (5%) said that rainforests provided human habitats. These observations are generally consistent with our previous studies of pupils’ views about the use and conservation of rainforests, in which girls were shown to be more sympathetic to animals and expressed views which seem to place an intrinsic value on non-human animal life. The fourth question concerned the causes of the destruction of rainforests. Perhaps encouragingly, more than half of the pupils (59%) identified that it is human activities which are destroying rainforests, some personalising the responsibility by the use of terms such as ‘we are’. About 18% of the pupils referred specifically to logging activity. One misconception, expressed by some 10% of the pupils, was that acid rain is responsible for rainforest destruction; a similar proportion said that pollution is destroying rainforests. Here, children are confusing rainforest destruction with damage to the forests of Western Europe by these factors. While two fifths of the students provided the information that the rainforests provide oxygen, in some cases this response also embraced the misconception that rainforest destruction would reduce atmospheric oxygen, making the atmosphere incompatible with human life on Earth. In answer to the final question about the importance of rainforest conservation, the majority of children simply said that we need rainforests to survive. Only a few of the pupils (6%) mentioned that rainforest destruction may contribute to global warming. This is surprising considering the high level of media coverage on this issue. Some children expressed the idea that the conservation of rainforests is not important. The results of this study suggest that certain ideas predominate in the thinking of children about rainforests. Pupils’ responses indicate some misconceptions in basic scientific knowledge of rainforests’ ecosystems such as their ideas about rainforests as habitats for animals, plants and humans and the relationship between climatic change and destruction of rainforests. Pupils did not volunteer ideas that suggested that they appreciated the complexity of causes of rainforest destruction. In other words, they gave no indication of an appreciation of either the range of ways in which rainforests are important or the complex social, economic and political factors which drive the activities which are destroying the rainforests. One encouragement is that the results of similar studies about other environmental issues suggest that older children seem to acquire the ability to appreciate, value and evaluate conflicting views. Environmental education offers an arena in which these skills can be developed, which is essential for these children as future decision-makers.

W Wh ha at t D Do o W Wh ha al le es s F Fe ee el l? ? An examination of the functioning of the senses in cetaceans, the group of mammals comprising whales, dolphins and porpoises
Some of the senses that we and other terrestrial mammals take for granted are either reduced or absent in cetaceans or fail to function well in water. For example, it appears from their brain structure that toothed species are unable to smell. Baleen species, on the other hand, appear to have some related brain structures but it is not known whether these are functional. It has been speculated that, as the blowholes evolved and migrated to the top of the head, the neural pathways serving sense of smell may have been nearly all sacriﬁced. Similarly, although at least some cetaceans have taste buds, the nerves serving these have degenerated or are rudimentary.
The sense of touch has sometimes been described as weak too, but this view is probably mistaken. Trainers of captive dolphins and small whales often remark on their animals’ responsiveness to being touched or rubbed, and both captive and freeranging cetacean individuals of all species (particularly adults and calves, or members of the same subgroup) appear to make frequent contact. This contact may help to maintain order within a group, and stroking or touching are part of the courtship ritual in most species. The area around the blowhole is also particularly sensitive and captive animals often object strongly to being touched there.
Test 1
24
The sense of vision is developed to different degrees in different species. Baleen species studied at close quarters underwater – speciﬁcally a grey whale calf in captivity for a year, and free-ranging right whales and humpback whales studied and ﬁlmed off Argentina and Hawaii – have obviously tracked objects with vision underwater, and they can apparently see moderately well both in water and in air. However, the position of the eyes so restricts the ﬁeld of vision in baleen whales that they probably do not have stereoscopic vision.
On the other hand, the position of the eyes in most dolphins and porpoises suggests that they have stereoscopic vision forward and downward. Eye position in freshwater dolphins, which often swim on their side or upside down while feeding, suggests that what vision they have is stereoscopic forward and upward. By comparison, the bottlenose dolphin has extremely keen vision in water. Judging from the way it watches and tracks airborne ﬂying ﬁsh, it can apparently see fairly well through the air–water interface as well. And although preliminary experimental evidence suggests that their in-air vision is poor, the accuracy with which dolphins leap high to take small ﬁsh out of a trainer’s hand provides anecdotal evidence to the contrary.
Such variation can no doubt be explained with reference to the habitats in which individual species have developed. For example, vision is obviously more useful to species inhabiting clear open waters than to those living in turbid rivers and ﬂooded plains. The South American boutu and Chinese beiji, for instance, appear to have very limited vision, and the Indian susus are blind, their eyes reduced to slits that probably allow them to sense only the direction and intensity of light.
Although the senses of taste and smell appear to have deteriorated, and vision in water appears to be uncertain, such weaknesses are more than compensated for by cetaceans’ well-developed acoustic sense. Most species are highly vocal, although they vary in the range of sounds they produce, and many forage for food using echolocation1. Large baleen whales primarily use the lower frequencies and are often limited in their repertoire. Notable exceptions are the nearly song-like choruses of bowhead whales in summer and the complex, haunting utterances of the humpback whales. Toothed species in general employ more of the frequency spectrum, and produce a wider variety of sounds, than baleen species (though the sperm whale apparently produces a monotonous series of high-energy clicks and little else). Some of the more complicated sounds are clearly communicative, although what role they may play in the social life and ‘culture’ of cetaceans has been more the subject of wild speculation than of solid science.

Visual Symbols and the Blind
Part 1 From a number of recent studies, it has become clear that blind people can appreciate the use of outlines and perspectives to describe the arrangement of objects and other surfaces in space. But pictures are more than literal representations. This fact was drawn to my attention dramatically when a blind woman in one of my investigations decided on her own initiative to draw a wheel as it was spinning. To show this motion, she traced a curve inside the circle (Fig. 1). I was taken aback. Lines of motion, such as the one she used, are a very recent invention in the history of illustration. Indeed, as art scholar David Kunzle notes, Wilhelm Busch, a trend-setting nineteenth-century cartoonist, used virtually no motion lines in his popular ﬁgures until about 1877.
When I asked several other blind study subjects to draw a spinning wheel, one particularly clever rendition appeared repeatedly: several subjects showed the wheel’s spokes as curved lines. When asked about these curves, they all described them as metaphorical ways of suggesting motion. Majority rule would argue that this device somehow indicated motion very well. But was it a better indicator than, say, broken or wavy lines – or any other kind of line, for that matter? The answer was not clear. So I decided to test whether various lines of motion were apt ways of showing movement or if they were merely idiosyncratic marks. Moreover, I wanted to discover whether there were differences in how the blind and the sighted interpreted lines of motion.
To search out these answers, I created raised-line drawings of ﬁve different wheels, depicting spokes with lines that curved, bent, waved, dashed and extended beyond the perimeter of the wheel. I then asked eighteen blind volunteers to feel the wheels and assign one of the following motions to each wheel: wobbling, spinning fast, spinning steadily, jerking or braking. My control group consisted of eighteen sighted undergraduates from the University of Toronto.
All but one of the blind subjects assigned distinctive motions to each wheel. Most guessed that the curved spokes indicated that the wheel was spinning steadily; the wavy spokes, they thought, suggested that the wheel was wobbling; and the bent spokes were taken as a sign that the wheel was jerking. Subjects assumed that spokes extending beyond the wheel’s perimeter signiﬁed that the wheel had its brakes on and that dashed spokes indicated the wheel was spinning quickly.
Fig.1
Test 1
28
In addition, the favoured description for the sighted was the favoured description for the blind in every instance. What is more, the consensus among the sighted was barely higher than that among the blind. Because motion devices are unfamiliar to the blind, the task I gave them involved some problem solving. Evidently, however, the blind not only ﬁgured out meanings for each line of motion, but as a group they generally came up with the same meaning at least as frequently as did sighted subjects.
Part 2 We have found that the blind understand other kinds of visual metaphors as well. One blind woman drew a picture of a child inside a heart – choosing that symbol, she said, to show that love surrounded the child. With Chang Hong Liu, a doctoral student from China, I have begun exploring how well blind people understand the symbolism behind shapes such as hearts that do not directly represent their meaning.
We gave a list of twenty pairs of words to sighted subjects and asked them to pick from each pair the term that best related to a circle and the term that best related to a square. For example, we asked: What goes with soft? A circle or a square? Which shape goes with hard?
All our subjects deemed the circle soft and the square hard. A full 94% ascribed happy to the circle, instead of sad. But other pairs revealed less agreement: 79% matched fast to slow and weak to strong, respectively. And only 51% linked deep to circle and shallow to square. (See Fig. 2.) When we tested four totally blind volunteers using the same list, we found that their choices closely resembled those made by the sighted subjects. One man, who had been blind since birth, scored extremely well. He made only one match differing from the consensus, assigning ‘far’ to square and ‘near’ to circle. In fact, only a small majority of sighted subjects – 53% – had paired far and near to the opposite partners. Thus, we concluded that the blind interpret abstract shapes as sighted people do.

 document these spect acu l ar monuments f r om a bygone e ra During the sixth and seventh centuries, the inhabitants of the modern-day states of Gujarat and Rajasthan in north-western India developed a method of gaining access to clean, fresh groundwater during the dry season for drinking, bathing, watering animals and irrigation. However, the significance of this invention - the stepwell - goes beyond its utilitarian application.
Unique to this region, stepwells are often architecturally complex and vary widely in size and shape. During their heyday, they were places of gathering, of leisure and relaxation and of worship for villagers of all but the lowest classes. Most stepwells are found dotted round the desert areas of Gujarat (where they are called vav) and Rajasthan (where they are called baori), while a few also survive in Delhi. Some were located in or near villages as public spaces for the community； others were positioned beside roads as resting places for travellers.
As their name suggests, stepwells comprise a series of stone steps descending from ground level to the
water source (normally an underground aquifer) as it recedes following the rains. When the water level was high, the user needed only to descend a few steps to reach it； when it was low, several levels would have to be negotiated.
Some wells are vast, open craters with hundreds of steps paving each sloping side, often in tiers. Others are more elaborate, with long stepped passages leading to the water via several storeys. Built from stone and supported by pillars, they also included pavilions that sheltered visitors from the relentless heat. But perhaps the most impressive features are the intricate decorative sculptures that embellish many stepwells, showing activities from fighting and dancing to everyday acts such as women combing their hair or churning butter.
Down the centuries, thousands of wells were constructed throughout northwestern India, but the majority have now fallen into disuse； many are derelict and dry, as groundwater has been diverted for industrial use and the wells no longer reach the water table. Their condition

hasn’t been helped by recent dry spells：
 southern Rajasthan suffered an eight-year drought between 1996 and 2004.
However, some important sites in Gujarat have recently undergone major restoration, and the state government announced in June last year that it plans to restore the stepwells throughout the state.
In Patan, the state’s ancient capital, the stepwell of Rani Ki V a v (Queen’s Stepwell) is perhaps the finest current example. It was built by Queen Udayamati during the late 11th century, but became silted up following a flood during the 13th century. But the Archaeological Survey of India began restoring it in the 1960s, and today it is in pristine condition. At 65 metres long, 20 metres wide and 27 metres deep, Rani Ki V a v features 500 sculptures carved into niches throughout the monument. Incredibly, in January 2001, this ancient structure survived an earthquake that measured 7.6 on the Richter scale.
Another example is the Su r y a K und in Modhera, northern Gujarat, next to the Sun Temple, built by King Bhima I in 1026 to honour the sun god Surya. It actually resembles a tank (kund means reservoir or pond) rather than a well, but displays the hallmarks of stepwell architecture, including four sides of steps that descend to the bottom in a stunning geometrical formation. The terraces house 108 small, intricately carved shrines between the sets of steps.
Rajasthan also has a wealth of wells. The ancient city of Bundi, 200 kilometres south of Jaipur, is renowned for its architecture, including its stepwells.
One of the larger examples is Raniji Ki
 Bao r i, which was built by the queen of the region, Nathavatji, in 1699. At 46 metres deep, 20 metres wide and 40 metres long, the intricately carved monument is one of 21 bao r is commissioned in the Bundi area by Nathavatji.
In the old ruined town of Abhaneri, about 95 kilometres east of Jaipur, is Chand
 Bao r i ，one of India’s oldest and deepest wells； aesthetically it’s perhaps one of the most dramatic. Built in around 850 AD next to the temple of Harshat Mata, the bao r i comprises hundreds of zigzagging steps that run along three of its sides, steeply descending 11 storeys, resulting in a striking pattern when seen from afar. On the fourth side, verandas which are supported by ornate pillars overlook the steps.
Still in public use is Neem rana Ki Bao r i,
 located just off the Jaipur-Delhi highway. Constructed in around 1700~it is nine storeys deep, with the last two being underwater. At ground level, there are 86 colonnaded openings from where the visitor descends 170 steps to the deepest water source.
Today, following years of neglect, many of these monuments to medieval engineering have been saved by the Archaeological Survey of India, which has recognised the importance of preserving them as part of the country’s rich history. Tourists flock to wells in far-flung corners of northwestern India to gaze in wonder at these architectural marvels from hundreds of years ago, which serve as a reminder of both the ingenuity and artistry of ancient civilisations and of the value of water to human existence.

EUROPEAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS 1990-2010
What have been the trends and what are the prospects for European transport systems? A It is difficult to conceive of vigorous economic growth without an efficient transport system. Although modern information technologies can reduce the demand for physical transport by facilitating teleworking and teleservices, the requirement for transport continues to increase. There are two key factors behind this trend. For passenger transport, the determining factor is the spectacular growth in car use. The number of cars on European Union (EU) roads saw an increase of three million cars each year from 1990 to 2010, and in the next decade the EU will see a further substantial increase in its fleet. B As far as goods transport is concerned, growth is due to a large extent to changes in the European economy and its system of production. In the last 20 years, as internal frontiers have been abolished, the EU has moved from a ‘stock’ economy to a 'flow* economy. This phenomenon has been emphasised by the relocation of some industries, particularly those which are labour intensive, to reduce production costs, even though the production site is hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away from the final assembly plant or away from users. C The strong economic growth expected in countries which are candidates for entry to the EU will also increase transport flows, in particular road haulage traffic. In 1998, some of these countries already exported more than twice their 1990 volumes and imported more than five times their 1990 volumes. And although many candidate countries inherited a transport system which encourages rail, the distribution between modes has tipped sharply in favour of road transport since the 1990s. Between 1990 and 1998~road haulage increased by 19.4%, while during the same period rail haulage decreased by 43.5%, although - and this could benefit the enlarged EU 一 it is still on average at a much higher level than in existing member states. D However, a new imperative - sustainable development - offers an opportunity for adapting the EU,s common transport policy. This objective, agreed by the Gothenburg European Council, has to be achieved by integrating environmental considerations into Community policies, and shifting the balance between modes of transport lies at the heart of its strategy. The ambitious objective can only be fully achieved by 2020, but proposed measures are nonetheless a first essential step towards a sustainable transport system which will ideally be in place in 30 years’ time, that is by 2040.
22
Reading
E In 1998，energy consumption in the transport sector was to blame for 28% of emissions of CCI2~the leading greenhouse gas. According to the latest estimates, if nothing is done to reverse the traffic growth trend, GO2 emissions from transport can be expected to increase by around 50% to 1,113 billion tonnes by 2020, compared with the 739 billion tonnes recorded in 1990. Once again, road transport is the main culprit since it alone accounts for 84% of the CO2 emissions attributable to transport. Using alternative fuels and improving energy efficiency is thus both an ecological necessity and a technological challenge. F At the same time greater efforts must be made to achieve a modal shift. Such a change cannot be achieved overnight, all the less so after over half a century of constant deterioration in favour of road. This has reached such a pitch that today rail freight services are facing marginalisation, with just 8% of market share, and with international goods trains struggling along at an average speed of 1 巳km/h. Three possible options have emerged. G The first approach would consist of focusing on road transport solely through pricing. This option would not be accompanied by complementary measures in the other modes of transport. In the short term it might curb the growth in road transport through the better loading ratio of goods vehicles and occupancy rates of passenger vehicles expected as a result of the increase in the price of transport. However, the lack of measures available to revitalise other modes of transport would make it impossible for more sustainable modes of transport to take up the baton. H The second approach also concentrates on road transport pricing but is accompanied by measures to increase the efficiency of the other modes (better quality of services, logistics, technology). However, this approach does not include investment in new infrastructure, nor does it guarantee better regional cohesion. It could help to achieve greater uncoupling than the first approach, but road transport would keep the lion’s share of the market and continue to concentrate on saturated arteries, despite being the most polluting of the modes. It is therefore not enough to guarantee the necessary shift of the balance. I The third approach, which is not new, comprises a series of measures ranging from pricing to revitalising alternative modes of transport and targeting investment in the trans-European network. This integrated approach would allow the market shares of the other modes to return to their 1998 levels and thus make a shift of balance. It is far more ambitious than it looks, bearing in mind the historical imbalance in favour of roads for the last fifty years, but would achieve a marked break in the link between road transport growth and economic growth, without placing restrictions on the mobility of people and goods.

22 The need for transport is growing, despite technological developments. 23 To reduce production costs, some industries have been moved closer to their relevant consumers. 24 Cars are prohibitively expensive in some EU candidate countries. 25 The Gothenburg European Council was set up 30 years ago. 26 By the end of this decade, C〇2 emissions from transport are predicted to reach 739 billion tonnes.

READING PASSAGE 3
You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40， which are based on Reading Passage 3 below. The psychology of innovation W h y a r e so few companies t ru ly innov a tive ? Innovation is key to business survival, and companies put substantial resources into inspiring employees to develop new ideas. There are, nevertheless, people working in luxurious, state-of-the-art centres designed to stimulate innovation who find that their environment doesn’t make them feel at all creative. And there are those who don’t have a budget, or much space, but who innovate successfully.
For Robert B. Cialdini, Professor of Psychology at Arizona State University, one reason that companies don’t succeed as often as they should is that innovation starts with recruitment. Research shows that the fit between an employee’s values and a company’s values makes a difference to what contribution they make and whether, two years after they join, they’re still at the company. Studies at Harvard Business School show that, although some individuals may be more creative than others, almost every individual can be creative in the right circumstances.
One of the most famous photographs in the story of rock’n’roll emphasises Cialdini’s views. The 1956 picture of singers Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis jamming at a piano in Sun Studios in Memphis tells a hidden story. Sun’s ‘million-dollar quartet~could have been a quintet. Missing from the picture is Roy Orbison, a greater natural singer than Lewis, Perkins or Cash. Sam Phillips,
who owned Sun, wanted to revolutionise popular music with songs that fused black and white music, and country and blues. Presley, Cash, Perkins and Lewis instinctively understood Phillips’s ambition and believed in it. Orbison wasn’t inspired by the goal, and only ever achieved one hit with the Sun label.
The value fit matters, says Cialdini, because innovation is, in part, a process of change, and under that pressure we, as a species, behave differently, ‘When things change, we are hard-wired to play it safe.~Managers should therefore adopt an approach that appears counterintuitive - they should explain what stands to be lost if the company fails to seize a particular opportunity. Studies show that we invariably take more gambles when threatened with a loss than when offered a reward.
Managing innovation is a delicate art. It’s easy for a company to be pulled in conflicting directions as the marketing, product development, and finance departments each get different feedback from different sets of people. And without a system which ensures collaborative exchanges within the company, it’s also easy for small ‘pockets of innovation~to disappear. Innovation is a contact sport. You can’t brief people just by saying, ‘We’re going in this direction and I~m going to take you with me/ 25
Test 1
Cialdini believes that this ‘follow-the- leader syndrome，is dangerous, not least because it encourages bosses to go it alone. ‘It’s been scientifically proven that three people will be better than one at solving problems, even if that one person is the smartest person in the field.，To prove his point, Cialdini cites an interview with molecular biologist James Watson. Watson, together with Francis Crick, discovered the structure of DNA, the genetic information carrier of all living organisms. ‘When asked how they had cracked the code ahead of an array of highly accomplished rival investigators, he said something that stunned me. He said he and Crick had succeeded because they were aware that they weren’t the most intelligent of the scientists pursuing the answer. The smartest scientist was called Rosalind Franklin who, Watson said, “was so intelligent she rarely sought advice'，
Teamwork taps into one of the basic drivers of human behaviour. ‘The principle of social proof is so pervasive that we don’t even recognise it~~says Cialdini. ‘If your project is being resisted, for example, by a group of veteran employees, ask another old-timer to speak up for it.’ Cialdini is not alone in advocating this strategy. Research shows that peer power, used horizontally not vertically, is much more powerful than any boss’s speech.
Writing, visualising and prototyping can stimulate the flow of new ideas. Cialdini cites scores of research papers and historical events that prove that even something as simple as writing deepens every individual^ engagement in the project. It is, he says, the reason why all those competitions on breakfast cereal
packets encouraged us to write in saying, in no more than 10 words: ‘I like Kellogg’s Com Flakes because... •’ The very act of writing makes us more likely to believe it.
Authority doesn’t have to inhibit innovation but it often does. The wrong kind of leadership will lead to what Cialdini calls ‘captainitis~the regrettable tendency of team members to opt out of team responsibilities that are properly theirs' He calls it captainitis because, he says, ‘crew members of multipilot aircraft exhibit a sometimes deadly passivity when the flight captain makes a clearly wrong-headed decision’. This behaviour is not, he says, unique to air travel, but can happen in any workplace where the leader is overbearing.
At the other end of the scale is the 1980s Memphis design collective, a group of young designers for whom ‘the only rule was that there were no rules' This environment encouraged a free interchange of ideas, which led to more creativity with form, function, colour and materials that revolutionised attitudes to furniture design.
Many theorists believe the ideal boss should lead from behind, taking pride in collective accomplishment and giving credit where it is due. Cialdini says: ‘Leaders should encourage everyone to contribute and simultaneously assure all concerned that every recommendation is important to making the right decision and will be given full attention., The frustrating thing about innovation is that there are many approaches, but no magic formula. However, a manager who wants to create a truly innovative culture can make their job a lot easier by recognising these psychological realities.

Tea and the Industrial Revolution

 the In dust r i a l Revolution in B r it a in. A nj ana A huj a r epo r ts
A Alan Macfarlane, professor of anthropological science at Kings College, Cambridge, has, like other historians, spent decades wrestling with the enigma of the Industrial Revolution. Why did this particular Big Bang — the world-changing birth of industry — happen in Britain? And why did it strike at the end of the 18th century?
B Macfarlane compares the puzzle to a combination lock. 'There are about 20 different factors and all of them need to be present before the revolution can happen,5 he says. For industry to take off, there needs to be the technology and power to drive factories, large urban populations to provide cheap labour, easy transport to move goods around, an affluent middle-class willing to buy mass-produced objects, a market-driven economy and a political system that allows this to happen. While this was the case for England, other nations, such as Japan, the Netherlands and France also met some of these criteria but were not industrialising. All these factors must have been necessary but not sufficient to cause the revolution,，says Macfarlane. ‘After all, Holland had everything except coal, while China also had many of these factors. Most historians are convinced there are one or two missing factors that you need to open the lock.，
C The missing factors, he proposes, are to be found in almost every kitchen cupboard. Tea and beer, two of the nations favourite drinks, fuelled the revolution. The antiseptic properties of tannin, the active ingredient in tea, and of hops in beer - plus the fact that both are made with boiled water 一 allowed urban communities to flourish at close quarters without succumbing to water-borne diseases such as dysentery. The theory sounds eccentric but once he starts to explain the detective work that went into his deduction, the scepticism gives way to wary admiration. Macfarlanes case has been strengthened by support from notable quarters - Roy Porter, the distinguished medical historian, recently wrote a favourable appraisal of his research.
D Macfarlane had wondered for a long time how the Industrial Revolution came about. Historians had alighted on one interesting factor around the mid-18th century that required explanation. Between about 1650 and 1740, the population in Britain was static. But then there was a burst in population growth. Macfarlane says: ‘The infant mortality rate halved in the space of 20 years, and this happened in both rural areas and cities, and across all classes. People suggested four possible causes. Was there a sudden change in the viruses and bacteria around? Unlikely. Was there a revolution in medical science? But this was a century before Listers revolution*. Was there a change in environmental conditions? There were improvements in agriculture that wiped out malaria, but these were small gains. Sanitation did not become widespread until the 19th century. The only option left is food. But the height and weight statistics show a decline. So the food must have got worse. Efforts to explain this sudden reduction in child deaths appeared to draw a blank.，
* Joseph Lister was the first doctor to use antiseptic techniques during surgical operations to prevent infections.

E This population burst seemed to happen at just the right time to provide labour for the Industrial Revolution. ‘When you start moving towards an industrial revolution, it is economically efficient to have people living close together，’ says Macfarlane. ‘But then you get disease, particularly from human waste.’ Some digging around in historical records revealed that there was a change in the incidence of water-borne disease at that time, especially dysentery. Macfarlane deduced that whatever the British were drinking must have been important in regulating disease. He says, ‘We drank beer. For a long time, the English were protected by the strong antibacterial agent in hops, which were added to help preserve the beer. But in the late 17th century a tax was introduced on malt, the basic ingredient of beer. The poor turned to water and gin and in the 1720s the mortality rate began to rise again. Then it suddenly dropped again. What caused this?，
F Macfarlane looked to Japan, which was also developing large cities about the same time, and also had no sanitation. Water-borne diseases had a much looser grip on the Japanese population than those in Britain. Could it be the prevalence of tea in their culture? Macfarlane then noted that the history of tea in Britain provided an extraordinary coincidence of dates. Tea was relatively expensive until Britain started a direct clipper trade with China in the early 18th century. By the 1740s, about the time that infant mortality was dipping, the drink was common. Macfarlane guessed that the fact that water had to be boiled, together with the stomach-purifying properties of tea meant that the breast milk provided by mothers was healthier than it had ever been. No other European nation sipped tea like the British, which, by Macfarlanes logic, pushed these other countries out of contention for the revolution.
G But, if tea is a factor in the combination lock, why didn’t Japan forge ahead in a tea-soaked industrial revolution of its own? Macfarlane notes that even though 17th-century Japan had large cities, high literacy rates, even a futures market, it had turned its back on the essence of any work-based revolution by giving up labour-saving devices such as animals, afraid that they would put people out of work. So, the nation that we now think of as one of the most technologically advanced entered the 19th century having abandoned the wheel5.

READING PASSAGE 2 You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.
Gifted children and learning
A Internationally, /giftedness/ is most frequently determined by a score on a general intelligence test, known as an IQ test, which is above a chosen cutoff point, usually at around the top 2-5%. Children's educational environment contributes to the IQ score and the way intelligence is used. For example, a very close positive relationship was found when children's IQ scores were compared with their home educational provision (Freeman, 2010). The higher the children's IQ scores, especially over IQ 130, the better the quality of their educational backup, measured in terms of reported verbal interactions with parents, number of books and activities in their home etc. Because IQ tests are decidedly influenced by what the child has learned, they are to some extent measures of current achievement based on age-norms; that is, how well the children have learned to manipulate their knowledge and know-how within the terms of the test. The vocabulary aspect, for example, is dependent on having heard those words. But IQ tests can neither identify the processes of learning and thinking nor predict creativity.
B Excellence does not emerge without appropriate help. To reach an exceptionally high standard in any area very able children need the means to learn, which includes material to work with and focused challenging tuition - and the encouragement to follow their dream. There appears to be a qualitative difference in the way the intellectually highly able think, compared with more average-ability or older pupils, for whom external regulation by the teacher often compensates for lack of internal regulation. To be at their most effective in their self-regulation, all children can be helped to identify their own ways of learning - metacognition - which will include strategies of planning, monitoring, evaluation, and choice of what to learn. Emotional awareness is also part of metacognition, so children should be helped to be aware of their feelings around the area to be learned, feelings of curiosity or confidence, for example.
C High achievers have been found to use self-regulatory learning strategies more often and more effectively than lower achievers, and are better able to transfer these strategies to deal with unfamiliar tasks. This happens to such a high degree in some children that they appear to be demonstrating talent in particular areas. Overviewing research on the thinking process of highly able

Test 2
children, (Shore and Kanevsky, 1993) put the instructor's problem succinctly: If they [the gifted] merely think more quickly, then we need only teach more quickly. If they merely make fewer errors, then we can shorten the practice'. But of course, this is not entirely the case; adjustments have to be made in methods of learning and teaching, to take account of the many ways individuals think.
D Yet in order to learn by themselves, the gifted do need some support from their teachers. Conversely, teachers who have a tendency to 'overdirect' can diminish their gifted pupils' learning autonomy. Although 'spoon-feeding' can produce extremely high examination results, these are not always followed by equally impressive life successes. Too much dependence on the teacher risks loss of autonomy and motivation to discover. However, when teachers help pupils to reflect on their own learning and thinking activities, they increase their pupils' self-regulation. For a young child, it may be just the simple question 'What have you learned today?' which helps them to recognise what they are doing. Given that a fundamental goal of education is to transfer the control of learning from teachers to pupils, improving pupils' learning to learn techniques should be a major outcome of the school experience, especially for the highly competent. There are quite a number of new methods which can help, such as child- initiated learning, ability-peer tutoring, etc. Such practices have been found to be particularly useful for bright children from deprived areas.
E But scientific progress is not all theoretical, knowledge is also vital to outstanding performance: individuals who know a great deal about a specific domain will achieve at a higher level than those who do not (Elshout, 1995). Research with creative scientists by Simonton (1988) brought him to the conclusion that above a certain high level, characteristics such as independence seemed to contribute more to reaching the highest levels of expertise than intellectual skills, due to the great demands of effort and time needed for learning and practice. Creativity in all forms can be seen as expertise mixed with a high level of motivation (Weisberg, 1993).
F To sum up, learning is affected by emotions of both the individual and significant others. Positive emotions facilitate the creative aspects of learning and negative emotions inhibit it. Fear, for example, can limit the development of curiosity, which is a strong force in scientific advance, because it motivates problem-solving behaviour. In Boekaerts' (1991) review of emotion in the learning of very high IQ and highly achieving children, she found emotional forces in harness. They were not only curious, but often had a strong desire to control their environment, improve their learning efficiency, and increase their own learning resources.

READING PASSAGE 3 You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below. Museums of fine art and their public The fact that people go to the Louvre museum in Paris to see the original painting Mona Lisa when they can see a reproduction anywhere leads us to question some assumptions about the role of museums of fine art in today's world One of the most famous works of art in the world is Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Nearly everyone who goes to see the original will already be familiar with it from reproductions, but they accept that fine art is more rewardingly viewed in its original form. However, if Mona Lisa was a famous novel, few people would bother to go to a museum to read the writer's actual manuscript rather than a printed reproduction. This might be explained by the fact that the novel has evolved precisely because of technological developments that made it possible to print out huge numbers of texts, whereas oil paintings have always been produced as unique objects. In addition, it could be argued that the practice of interpreting or 'reading' each medium follows different conventions. With novels, the reader attends mainly to the meaning of words rather than the way they are printed on the page, whereas the 'reader' of a painting must attend just as closely to the material form of marks and shapes in the picture as to any ideas they may signify. Yet it has always been possible to make very accurate facsimiles of pretty well any fine art work. The seven surviving versions of Mona Lisa bear witness to the fact that in the 16th century, artists seemed perfectly content to assign the reproduction of their creations to their workshop apprentices as regular 'bread and butter' work. And today the task of reproducing pictures is incomparably more simple and reliable, with reprographic techniques that allow the production of high-quality prints made exactly to the original scale, with faithful colour values, and even with duplication of the surface relief of the painting. But despite an implicit recognition that the spread of good reproductions can be culturally valuable, museums continue to promote the special status of original work. Unfortunately, this seems to place severe limitations on the kind of experience offered to visitors. One limitation is related to the way the museum presents its exhibits. As repositories of unique historical objects, art museums are often called 'treasure houses'. We are reminded of this even before we view a collection by the presence of security guards, attendants, ropes and display cases to keep us away from the exhibits. In many cases, the architectural style of the building further reinforces that notion. In addition, a major collection like that of London's 49
Test 2
National Gallery is housed in numerous rooms, each with dozens of works, any one of which is likely to be worth more than all the average visitor possesses. In a society that judges the personal status of the individual so much by their material worth, it is therefore difficult not to be impressed by one's own relative 'worthlessness' in such an environment. Furthermore, consideration of the Value' of the original work in its treasure house setting impresses upon the viewer that, since these works were originally produced, they have been assigned a huge monetary value by some person or institution more powerful than themselves. Evidently, nothing the viewer thinks about the work is going to alter that value, and so today's viewer is deterred from trying to extend that spontaneous, immediate, self-reliant kind of reading which would originally have met the work. The visitor may then be struck by the strangeness of seeing such diverse paintings, drawings and sculptures brought together in an environment for which they were not originally created. This 'displacement effect' is further heightened by the sheer volume of exhibits. In the case of a major collection, there are probably more works on display than we could realistically view in weeks or even months. This is particularly distressing because time seems to be a vital factor in the appreciation of all art forms. A fundamental difference between paintings and other art forms is that there is no prescribed time over which a painting is viewed. By contrast,
the audience encounters an opera or a play over a specific time, which is the duration of the performance. Similarly, novels and poems are read in a prescribed temporal sequence, whereas a picture has no clear place at which to start viewing, or at which to finish. Thus art works themselves encourage us to view them superficially, without appreciating the richness of detail and labour that is involved. Consequently, the dominant critical approach becomes that of the art historian, a specialised academic approach devoted to 'discovering the meaning' of art within the cultural context of its time. This is in perfect harmony with the museum's function, since the approach is dedicated to seeking out and conserving 'authentic', 'original' readings of the exhibits. Again, this seems to put paid to that spontaneous, participatory criticism which can be found in abundance in criticism of classic works of literature, but is absent from most art history. The displays of art museums serve as a warning of what critical practices can emerge when spontaneous criticism is suppressed. The museum public, like any other audience, experience art more rewardingly when given the confidence to express their views. If appropriate works of fine art could be rendered permanently accessible to the public by means of high-fidelity reproductions, as literature and music already are, the public may feel somewhat less in awe of them. Unfortunately, that may be too much to ask from those who seek to maintain and control the art establishment.

Reading The Context, Meaning and Scope of Tourism
A Travel has existed since the beginning of time, when primitive man set out, often traversing great distances in search of game, which provided the food and clothing necessary for his survival. Throughout the course of history, people have travelled for purposes of trade, religious conviction, economic gain, war, migration and other equally compelling motivations. In the Roman era, wealthy aristocrats and high government officials also travelled for pleasure. Seaside resorts located at Pompeii and Herculaneum afforded citizens the opportunity to escape to their vacation villas in order to avoid the summer heat of Rome. Travel, except during the Dark Ages, has continued to grow and, throughout recorded history, has played a vital role in the development of civilisations and their economies. B Tourism in the mass form as we know it today is a distinctly twentieth-century phenomenon. Historians suggest that the advent of mass tourism began in England during the industrial revolution with the rise of the middle class and the availability of relatively inexpensive transportation. The creation of the commercial airline industry following the Second World War and the subsequent development of the jet aircraft in the 1950s signalled the rapid growth and expansion of international travel. This growth led to the development of a major new industry: tourism. In turn, international tourism became the concern of a number of world governments since it not only provided new employment opportunities but also produced a means of earning foreign exchange.
C Tourism today has grown significantly in both economic and social importance. In most industrialised countries over the past few years the fastest growth has been seen in the area of services. One of the largest segments of the service industry, although largely unrecognised as an entity in some of these countries, is travel and tourism. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council (1992)，‘Travel and tourism is the largest industry in the world on virtually any economic measure including value-added capital investment, employment and tax contributions，. In 1992，the industry’s gross output was estimated to be $3.5 trillion, over 12 per cent of all consumer spending. The travel and tourism industry is the world’s largest employer with almost 130 million jobs, or almost 7 per cent of all employees. This industry is the world’s leading industrial contributor, producing over 6 per cent of the world’s gross national product and accounting for capital investment in excess of $422 billion in direct, indirect and personal taxes each year. Thus, tourism has a profound impact both on the world economy and, because of the educative effect of travel and the effects on employment, on society itself.
65

D However, the major problems of the travel and tourism industry that have hidden, or obscured, its economic impact are the diversity and fragmentation of the industry itself. The travel industry includes: hotels, motels and other types of accommodation; restaurants and other food services; transportation services and facilities; amusements, attractions and other leisure facilities; gift shops and a large number of other enterprises. Since many of these businesses also serve local residents, the impact of spending by visitors can easily be overlooked or underestimated. In addition, Meis (1992) points out that the tourism industry involves concepts that have remained amorphous to both analysts and decision makers. Moreover, in all nations this problem has made it difficult for the industry to develop any type of reliable or credible tourism information base in order to estimate the contribution it makes to regional, national and global economies. However, the nature of this very diversity makes travel and tourism ideal vehicles for economic development in a wide variety of countries, regions or communities. E Once the exclusive province of the wealthy, travel and tourism have become an institutionalised way of life for most of the population. In fact, McIntosh and Goeldner (1990) suggest that tourism has become the largest commodity in international trade for many nations and, for a significant number of other countries, it ranks second or third. For example, tourism is the major source of income in Bermuda, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and most Caribbean countries. In addition, Hawkins and Ritchie, quoting from data published by the American Express Company, suggest that the travel and tourism industry is the number one ranked employer in the Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, France, (the former) West Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. However, because of problems of definition, which directly affect statistical measurement, it is not possible with any degree of certainty to provide precise, valid or reliable data about the extent of world-wide tourism participation or its economic impact. In many cases, similar difficulties arise when attempts are made to measure domestic tourism.

READING PASSAGE 2 You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below. Autumn leaves Canadi an w r ite r
 J a y In g ra m in vestig a tes the
 m yste r y o f w h y le a ves t urn r ed in the f a ll A One of the most captivating natural events of the year in many areas throughout North America is the turning of the leaves in the fall. The colours are magnificent, but the question of exactly why some trees turn yellow or orange, and others red or purple, is something which has long puzzled scientists.
B Summer leaves are green because they are full of chlorophyll, the molecule that captures sunlight and converts that energy into new building materials for the tree. As fall approaches in the northern hemisphere, the amount of solar energy available declines considerably. For many trees - evergreen conifers being an exception 一 the best strategy is to abandon photosynthesis* until the spring. So rather than maintaining the now redundant leaves throughout the winter, the tree saves its precious resources and discards them. But before letting its leaves go, the tree dismantles their chlorophyll molecules and ships their valuable nitrogen back into the twigs. As chlorophyll is depleted, other colours that have been dominated by it throughout the summer begin to be revealed. This unmasking explains the autumn colours of yellow and orange, but not the brilliant reds and purples of trees such as the maple or sumac.
C The source of the red is widely known: it is created by anthocyanins, water-soluble plant pigments reflecting the red to blue range of the visible spectrum. They belong to a class of sugar-based chemical compounds also known as flavonoids. What’s puzzling is that anthocyanins are actually newly minted, made in the leaves at the same time as the tree is preparing to drop them. But it is hard to make sense of the manufacture of anthocyanins - why should a tree bother making new chemicals in its leaves when it’s already scrambling to withdraw and preserve the ones already there?
D Some theories about anthocyanins have argued that they might act as a chemical defence against attacks by insects or fungi, or that they might attract fruit-eating birds or increase a leafs tolerance to freezing. However there are problems with each of these theories, including the fact that leaves are red for such a relatively short period that the expense of energy needed to manufacture the anthocyanins would outweigh any anti-fungal or anti-herbivore activity achieved.
* photosynthesis: the production of new material from sunlight, water and carbon dioxide 68
Reading
E It has also been proposed that trees may produce vivid red colours to convince herbivorous insects that they are healthy and robust and would be easily able to mount chemical defences against infestation. If insects paid attention to such advertisements, they might be prompted to lay their eggs on a duller，and presumably less resistant host. The flaw in this theory lies in the lack of proof to support it. No one has as yet ascertained whether more robust trees sport the brightest leaves, or whether insects make choices according to colour intensity.
F Perhaps the most plausible suggestion as to why leaves would go to the trouble of making anthocyanins when they’re busy packing up for the winter is the theory known as the ‘light screen，hypothesis. It sounds paradoxical, because the idea behind this hypothesis is that the red pigment is made in autumn leaves to protect chlorophyll, the light-absorbing chemical, from too much light. Why does chlorophyll need protection when it is the natural world’s supreme light absorber? Why protect chlorophyll at a time when the tree is breaking it down to salvage as much of it as possible?
G Chlorophyll, although exquisitely evolved to capture the energy of sunlight, can sometimes be overwhelmed by it, especially in situations of drought, low temperatures, or nutrient deficiency. Moreover, the problem of oversensitivity to light is even more acute in the fall, when the leaf is busy preparing for winter by dismantling its internal machinery. The energy absorbed by the chlorophyll molecules of the unstable autumn leaf is not immediately channelled into useful products and processes, as it would be in an intact summer leaf. The weakened fall leaf then becomes vulnerable to the highly destructive effects of the oxygen created by the excited chlorophyll molecules.
H Even if you had never suspected that this is what was going on when leaves turn red, there are clues out there. One is straightforward: on many trees, the leaves that are the reddest are those on the side of the tree which gets most sun. Not only that, but the red is brighter on the upper side of the leaf. It has also been recognised for decades that the best conditions for intense red colours are dry, sunny days and cool nights, conditions that nicely match those that make leaves susceptible to excess light. And finally, trees such as maples usually get much redder the more north you travel in the northern hemisphere. It’s colder there, they’re more stressed, their chlorophyll is more sensitive and it needs more sunblock.
I What is still not fully understood, however, is why some trees resort to producing red pigments while others don’t bother, and simply reveal their orange or yellow hues. Do these trees have other means at their disposal to prevent overexposure to light in autumn? Their story, though not as spectacular to the eye, will surely turn out to be as subtle and as complex.

READING PASSAGE 3 You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below. Beyond the blue horizon Ancient voyagers who settled the far-flung islands of the Pacific Ocean
An important archaeological discovery on the island of Efate in the Pacific archipelago of Vanuatu has revealed traces of an ancient seafaring people, the distant ancestors of todays Polynesians. The site came to light only by chance. An agricultural worker, digging in the grounds of a derelict plantation, scraped open a grave - the first of dozens in a burial ground some 3,000 years old. It is the oldest cemetery ever found in the Pacific islands, and it harbors the remains of an ancient people archaeologists call the Lapita.
They were daring blue-water adventurers who used basic canoes to rove across the ocean. But they were not just explorers. They were also pioneers who carried with them everything they would need to build new lives — their livestock, taro seedlings and stone tools. Within the span of several centuries, the Lapita stretched the boundaries of their world from the jungle-clad volcanoes of Papua New Guinea to the loneliest coral outliers of Tonga.
The Lapita left precious few clues about themselves, but Efatd expands the volume of data available to researchers dramatically. The remains of 62 individuals have been uncovered so far, and archaeologists were also thrilled to find six complete Lapita pots. Other items included a Lapita burial urn with modeled birds arranged on the rim as though peering down at the human remains sealed inside. ‘It’s an important discovery,J says Matthew Spriggs, professor of archaeology at the Australian National University and head of

Vanuatu ... IHH9 Tahiti HHBM the international team digging up the site, Tor it conclusively identifies the remains as Lapita.’
DNA teased from these human remains may help answer one of the most puzzling questions in Pacific anthropology: did all Pacific islanders spring from one source or many? Was there only one outward migration from a single point in Asia, or several from different points? ‘This represents the best opportunity we’ve had yet/ says Spriggs, to find out who the Lapita actually were, where they came from, and who their closest descendants are today/
There is one stubborn question for which archaeology has yet to provide any answers: how did the Lapita accomplish the ancient equivalent of a moon landing, many times over? No-one has found one of their canoes or any rigging, which could reveal how the canoes were sailed. Nor do the oral histories and traditions of later Polynesians offer any insights, for they turn into myths long before they reach as far back in time as the Lapita.
72
Reading
All we can say for certain is that the Lapita had canoes that were capable of ocean voyages, and they had the ability to sail them,，says Geoff Irwin, a professor of archaeology at the University of Auckland. Those sailing skills, he says, were developed and passed down over thousands of years by earlier mariners who worked their way through the archipelagoes of the western Pacific, making short crossings to nearby islands. The real adventure didn’t begin, however, until their Lapita descendants sailed out of sight of land, with empty horizons on every side. This must have been as difficult for them as landing on the moon is for us today. Certainly it distinguished them from their ancestors, but what gave them the courage to launch out on such risky voyages?
The Lapitas thrust into the Pacific was eastward, against the prevailing trade winds, Irwin notes. Those nagging headwinds, he argues, may have been the key to their success. ‘They could sail out for days into the unknown and assess the area, secure in the knowledge that if they didn’t find anything, they could turn about and catch a swift ride back on the trade winds. This is what would have made the whole thing work.，Once out there, skilled seafarers would have detected abundant leads to follow to land: seabirds, coconuts and twigs carried out to sea by the tides, and the afternoon pile-up of clouds on the horizon which often indicates an island in the distance.
For returning explorers, successful or not, the geography of their own archipelagoes would have provided a safety net. Without this to go by, overshooting their home ports, getting lost and sailing off into eternity would have been all too
easy. Vanuatu, for example, stretches more than 500 miles in a northwest-southeast trend, its scores of intervisible islands forming a backstop for mariners riding the trade winds home.
All this presupposes one essential detail, says Atholl Anderson, professor of prehistory at the Australian National University: the Lapita had mastered the advanced art of sailing against the wind. And there’s no proof they could do any such thing，，Anderson says. ‘There has been this assumption they did, and people have built canoes to re-create those early voyages based on that assumption. But nobody has any idea what their canoes looked like or how they were rigged/
Rather than give all the credit to human skill, Anderson invokes the winds of chance. El Nino, the same climate disruption that affects the Pacific today, may have helped scatter the Lapita, Anderson suggests. He points out that climate data obtained from slow-growing corals around the Pacific indicate a series of unusually frequent El Ninos around the time of the Lapita expansion. By reversing the regular east-to-west flow of the trade winds for weeks at a time, these super El Nifios’ might have taken the Lapita on long unplanned voyages.
However they did it, the Lapita spread themselves a third of the way across the Pacific, then called it quits for reasons known only to them. Ahead lay the vast emptiness of the central Pacific and perhaps they were too thinly stretched to venture farther. They probably never numbered more than a few thousand in total, and in their rapid migration eastward they encountered hundreds of islands — more than 300 in Fiji alone.

READING PASSAGE 1 You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13， which are based on Reading Passage 1 below. The megafires of California Drought, housing expansion, and oversupply of tinder make for bigger, hotter Gies in the western United States
Wildfires are becoming an increasing menace in the western United States, with Southern California being the hardest hit area. There’s a reason fire squads battling more frequent blazes in Southern California are having such difficulty containing the flames, despite better preparedness than ever and decades of experience fighting fires fanned by the 'Santa Ana Winds’. The wildfires themselves, experts say, are generally hotter, faster, and spread more erratically than in the past. Megafires, also called ‘siege fires’，
 are the increasingly frequent blazes that burn 500,000 acres or more - 10 times the size of the average forest fire of 20 years ago. Some recent wildfires are among the biggest ever in California in terms of acreage burned, according to state figures and news reports. One explanation for the trend to more superhot fires is that the region, which usually has dry summers, has had significantly below normal precipitation in many recent years. Another reason, experts say, is related to the century- long policy of the US Forest Service to stop wildfires as quickly as possible. The unintentional consequence has
been to halt the natural eradication of underbrush, now the primary fuel for megafires. Three other factors contribute to the trend, they add. First is climate change, marked by a 1-degree Fahrenheit rise in average yearly temperature across the western states. Second is fire seasons that on average are 78 days longer than they were 20 years ago. Third is increased construction of homes in wooded areas. ‘We are increasingly building our homes in fire-prone ecosystems,1 says Dominik Kulakowski, adjunct professor of biology at Clark University Graduate School of Geography in Worcester, Massachusetts. 1 Doing that in many of the forests of the western US is like building homes on the side of an active volcano.’ In California, where population growth has averaged more than 600,000 a year for at least a decade, more residential housing is being built. ‘What once was open space is now residential homes providing fuel to make fires burn with greater intensity,’ says Terry McHale of the California Department of Forestry firefighters’ union. ‘With so

much dryness, so many communities to catch fire, so many fronts to fight, it becomes an almost incredible job.1 That said, many experts give California high marks for making progress on preparedness in recent years, after some of the largest fires in state history scorched thousands of acres, burned thousands of homes, and killed numerous people. Stung in the past by criticism of bungling that allowed fires to spread when they might have been contained, personnel are meeting the peculiar challenges of neighborhood - and canyon- hopping fires better than previously, observers say. State promises to provide more up-to-date engines, planes, and helicopters to fight fires have been fulfilled. Firefighters’ unions that in the past complained of dilapidated equipment, old fire engines, and insufficient blueprints for fire safety are now praising the state's commitment, noting that funding for firefighting has increased, despite huge cuts in many other programs. ‘We are pleased that the current state administration has been very proactive in its support of us, and [has】 come through with budgetary support of the infrastructure needs we have long sought,1 says Mr. McHale of the firefighters’ union. Besides providing money to upgrade the fire engines that must traverse the mammoth state and wind along serpentine canyon roads, the state has
invested in better command-and-control facilities as well as in the strategies to run them. ‘In the fire sieges of earlier years, we found that other jurisdictions and states were willing to offer mutual-aid help, but we were not able to communicate adequately with them/ says Kim Zagaris, chief of the state’s Office of Emergency Services Fire and Rescue Branch. After a commission examined and revamped communications procedures, the statewide response ‘has become far more professional and responsive/ he says. There is a sense among both government officials and residents that the speed, dedication, and coordination of firefighters from several states and jurisdictions are resulting in greater efficiency than in past ‘siege fire’ situations. In recent years, the Southern California region has improved building codes, evacuation procedures, and procurement of new technology. ‘I am extraordinarily impressed by the improvements we have witnessed,’ says Randy Jacobs, a Southern California- based lawyer who has had to evacuate both his home and business to escape wildfires. ‘Notwithstanding all the damage that will continue to be caused by wildfires, we will no longer suffer the loss of life endured in the past because of the fire prevention and firefighting measures that have been put in place,’ he says.

With a little experimentation, people can reshape their temperaments and inject passion, optimism, joy and courage into their lives
A Psychologists have long held that a person's character cannot undergo a transformation in any meaningful way and that the key traits of personality are determined at a very young age. However, researchers have begun looking more closely at ways we can change. Positive psychologists have identified 24 qualities we admire, such as loyalty and kindness, and are studying them to find out why they come so naturally to some people. What they're discovering is that many of these qualities amount to habitual behaviour that determines the way we respond to the world. The good news is that all this can be learned. Some qualities are less challenging to develop than others, optimism being one of them. However, developing qualities requires mastering a range of skills which are diverse and sometimes surprising. For example, to bring more joy and passion into your life, you must be open to experiencing negative emotions. Cultivating such qualities will help you realise your full potential. B 'The evidence is good that most personality traits can be altered/ says Christopher Peterson, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, who cites himself as an example. Inherently introverted, he realised early on that as an academic, his reticence would prove disastrous in the lecture hall. So he learned to be more outgoing and to entertain his classes. 'Now my extroverted behaviour is spontaneous/ he says. C David Fajgenbaum had to make a similar transition. He was preparing for university, when he had an accident that put an end to his sports career. On campus, he quickly found that beyond ordinary counselling, the university had no services for students who were undergoing physical rehabilitation and suffering from depression like him. He therefore launched a support group to help others in similar situations. He took action despite his own pain ω a typical response of an optimist. D Suzanne Segerstrom, professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky, believes that the key to increasing optimism is through cultivating optimistic behaviour, rather than positive thinking. She recommends you train yourself to pay attention to good fortune by writing down three positive things that come about each day. This will help you convince yourself that favourable outcomes actually happen all the time, making it easier to begin taking action.

E You can recognise a person who is passionate about a pursuit by the way they are so strongly involved in it. Tanya Streeter's passion is freediving ω the sport of plunging deep into the water without tanks or other breathing equipment. Beginning in 1998, she set nine world records and can hold her breath for six minutes. The physical stamina required for this sport is intense but the psychological demands are even more overwhelming. Streeter learned to untangle her fears from her judgment of what her body and mind could do. 'In my career as a competitive freediver, there was a limit to what I could do - but it wasn't anywhere near what I thought it was/ she says. F Finding a pursuit that excites you can improve anyone's life. The secret about consuming passions, though, according to psychologist Paul Silvia of the University of North Carolina, is that 'they require discipline, hard work and ability, which is why they are so rewarding/ Psychologist Todd Kashdan has this advice for those people taking up a new passion: 'As a newcomer, you also have to tolerate and laugh at your own ignorance. You must be willing to accept the negative feelings that come your way/ he says. G In 2004, physician-scientist Mauro Zappaterra began his PhD research at Harvard Medical School. Unfortunately, he was miserable as his research wasn't compatible with his curiosity about healing. He finally took a break and during eight months in Santa Fe, Zappaterra learned about alternative healing techniques not taught at Harvard. When he got back, he switched labs to study how cerebrospinal fluid nourishes the developing nervous system. He also vowed to look for the joy in everything, including failure, as this could help him learn about his research and himself. One thing that can hold joy back is a person's concentration on avoiding failure rather than their looking forward to doing something well. 'Focusing on being safe might get in the way of your reaching your goals/ explains Kashdan. For example, are you hoping to get through a business lunch without embarrassing yourself, or are you thinking about how fascinating the conversation might be? H Usually, we think of courage in physical terms but ordinary life demands something else. For marketing executive Kenneth Pedeleose, it meant speaking out against something he thought was ethically wrong. The new manager was intimidating staff so Pedeleose carefully recorded each instance of bullying and eventually took the evidence to a senior director, knowing his own job security would be threatened. Eventually the manager was the one to go. According to Cynthia Pury, a psychologist at Clemson University, Pedeleose's story proves the point that courage is not motivated by fearlessness, but by moral obligation. Pury also believes that people can acquire courage. Many of her students said that faced with a risky situation, they first tried to calm themselves down, then looked for a way to mitigate the danger, just as Pedeleose did by documenting his allegations. Over the long term, picking up a new character trait may help you move toward being the person you want to be. And in the short term, the effort itself could be surprisingly rewarding, a kind of internal adventure.

READING PASSAGE 3 You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below. When evolution runs backwards Evolution isn’t supposed to run backwards - yet an increasing number of examples show that it does and that it can sometimes represent the future of a species
The description of any animal as an ‘evolutionary throwback’ is controversial. For the better part of a century, most biologists have been reluctant to use those words, mindful of a principle of evolution that says ‘evolution cannot run backwards~ . But as more and more examples come to light and modern genetics enters the scene, that principle is having to be rewritten. Not only are evolutionary throwbacks possible, they sometimes play an important role in the forward march of evolution.
The technical term for an evolutionary throwback is an ‘atavism~~from the Latin atavus~meaning forefather. The word has ugly connotations thanks largely to Cesare Lombroso, a 19th-century Italian medic who argued that criminals were born not made and could be identified by certain physical features that were throwbacks to a primitive, sub-human state.
While Lombroso was measuring criminals, a Belgian palaeontologist called Louis Dollo was studying fossil records and coming to the opposite conclusion. In 1890 he proposed that evolution was irreversible: that ‘an organism is unable to return, even partially, to a previous stage already realised in the ranks of its ancestors’. Early 20th-century biologists came to a similar conclusion, though they qualified it
in terms of probability, stating that there is no reason why evolution cannot run backwards - it is just very unlikely. And so the idea of irreversibility in evolution stuck and came to be known as ‘Dollo’s law~ .
If Dollo’s law is right, atavisms should occur only very rarely, if at all. Yet almost since the idea took root, exceptions have been cropping up. In 1919, for example, a humpback whale with a pair of leg-like appendages over a metre long, complete with a full set of limb bones, was caught off Vancouver Island in Canada. Explorer Roy Chapman Andrews argued at the time that the whale must be a throwback to a land-living ancestor. ‘I can see no other explanation~~he wrote in 1921.
Since then, so many other examples have been discovered that it no longer makes sense to say that evolution is as good as irreversible. And this poses a puzzle: how can characteristics that disappeared millions of years ago suddenly reappear? In 1994, Rudolf Raff and colleagues at Indiana University in the USA decided to use genetics to put a number on the probability of evolution going into reverse. They reasoned that while some evolutionary changes involve the loss of genes and are therefore irreversible, others may be the result of genes being switched off. If these
97
Test 4
silent genes are somehow switched back on, they argued, long-lost traits could reappear.
Raff’s team went on to calculate the likelihood of it happening. Silent genes accumulate random mutations, they reasoned, eventually rendering them useless. So how long can a gene survive in a species if it is no longer used? The team calculated that there is a good chance of silent genes surviving for up to 6 million years in at least a few individuals in a population, and that some might survive as long as 10 million years. In other words, throwbacks are possible, but only to the relatively recent evolutionary past.
As a possible example, the team pointed to the mole salamanders of Mexico and California. Like most amphibians these begin life in a juvenile ‘tadpole’ state, then metamorphose into the adult form - except for one species, the axolotl, which famously lives its entire life as a juvenile. The simplest explanation for this is that the axolotl lineage alone lost the ability to metamorphose, while others retained it. From a detailed analysis of the salamanders’ family tree, however, it is clear that the other lineages evolved from an ancestor that itself had lost the ability to metamorphose. In other words, metamorphosis in mole salamanders is an atavism. The salamander example fits with Raff’s 10-million-year time frame.
More recently, however, examples have been reported that break the time limit, suggesting that silent genes may not be the whole story. In a paper published last year, biologist Gunter Wagner of Yale University reported some work on the evolutionary
history of a group of South American lizards called Bachia. Many of these have minuscule limbs; some look more like snakes than lizards and a few have completely lost the toes on their hind limbs. Other species, however, sport up to four toes on their hind legs. The simplest explanation is that the toed lineages never lost their toes, but Wagner begs to differ. According to his analysis of the Bachia family tree, the toed species re-evolved toes from toeless ancestors and, what is more, digit loss and gain has occurred on more than one occasion over tens of millions of years.
So what’s going on? One possibility is that these traits are lost and then simply reappear, in much the same way that similar structures can independently arise in unrelated species, such as the dorsal fins of sharks and killer whales. Another more intriguing possibility is that the genetic information needed to make toes somehow survived for tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of years in the lizards and was reactivated. These atavistic traits provided an advantage and spread through the population, effectively reversing evolution.
But if silent genes degrade within 6 to 10 million years, how can long-lost traits be reactivated over longer timescales? The answer may lie in the womb. Early embryos of many species develop ancestral features. Snake embryos, for example, sprout hind limb buds. Later in development these features disappear thanks to developmental programs that say ‘lose the leg’. If for any reason this does not happen, the ancestral feature may not disappear, leading to an atavism.

SECTION 1 Questions 1+14 Read the text below and answer Questions 1-7. Smoke alarms in the home Smoke alarms are now a standard feature in Australian homes and are required by the National Building Code in any recently built properties. They are installed to detect the presence of smoke and emit a clear sound to alert you in the event of fire to give you time to escape.
There are two principal types of smoke alarms. Ionization alarms are the cheapest and most readily available smoke alarms. They are also very sensitive to 'flaming fires' - fires that burn fiercely - and will detect them before the smoke gets too thick. However, photoelectric alarms are more effective at detecting slow-burning fires. They are less likely to go off accidentally and so are best for homes with one floor. For the best protection, you should install one of each.
Most battery-powered smoke alarms can be installed by the home owner and do not require professional installation. For the installation of hard-wired smoke alarms, powered from the mains electricity supply, however, you will need the services of a licensed professional. Smoke alarms are usually most effective when located on the ceiling, near or in the middle of the room or hall.
Photoelectric smoke alarms in any quantity may be disposed of in domestic waste. If you have fewer than ten ionization alarms to get rid of, you may put them in your domestic waste. If you have more than ten to dispose of, you should contact your local council.
Your battery-powered smoke alarm will produce a short beep every 60 second to alert you when the battery is running out and needs replacing. Nevertheless, it should be tested every month to ensure that the battery and the alarm sounder are working. Note that the sensitivity in all smoke alarms will reduce over time.

USING DIRECT MAIL TO SELL YOUR PRODUCT When you have set up your own business, you must, of course, start selling your goods or services. One way is by using direct mail - in other words, sending a sales letter (or email) directly to companies that might want to do business with you. One important factor is your mailing list - that is, who you contact. You can build this up from your own market research, existing clients and advertising responses, or you can contact list brokers and rent or buy a compiled list. If you are contacting a business, it is important to address the letter to the decision maker, ideally by name or at least by job title. While the desirability and price of the product on offer will obviously influence sales, you also need to gain the maximum impact from your sales letter. To achieve that, bear the following points in mind: • You have no more than two seconds from when the reader starts the letter to convince them to continue. If you fail, they will throw it away. The opening is crucial to attract their attention. And so that they don't lose interest, avoid having too much text. • Try to send each mailing in a white envelope. It might be cheaper to use a brown envelope but it doesn't make for such good presentation. • Include a brochure. Depending on the volume and on whether you can afford the cost, try to use at least two-colour printing for this. If practicable, it may be worth enclosing a free sample - this is a much greater incentive than photographs. • However interested your potential clients are in buying, they will only do so if it can be done easily. So, include an order form (and of course details of how to return it) with your letter. • When you receive your replies, assess your response rate and monitor the sales. If necessary, the sales letter can then be amended to attract other clients on subsequent mail shots; make sure each different letter is coded so that monitoring is easy and effective. • Ensure that each reply is dealt with quickly and professionally. If further details are requested, these must be sent out promptly. There is no point in encouraging potential customers to contact you if your service is slow or non-existent.

SECTION 3 Questions 28+40 Read the text on pages 112 and 113 and answer Questions 2&~40. KAURI GUM - a piece of New Zealand's history A The kauri tree is a massive forest tree native to New Zealand. Kauri once formed vast forests over much of the north of the country. Whereas now it is the wood of the kauri which is an important natural resource, in the past it was the tree's sap (the thick liquid which flows inside a tree) which, when hardened into gum, played an important role in New Zealand's early history. After running from rips or tears in the bark of trees, the sap hardens to form the lumps of gum which eventually fall to the ground and are buried under layers of forest litter. The bark often splits where branches fork from the trunk, and gum accumulates there also. The early European settlers in New Zealand collected and sold the gum. Gum fresh from the tree was soft and of low value but most of the gum which was harvested had been buried for thousands of years. This gum came in a bewildering variety of colours, degree of transparency and hardness, depending on the length and location of burial, as well as the health of the original tree and the area of the bleeding. Highest quality gum was hard and bright and was usually found at shallow depth on the hills. Lowest quality gum was soft, black or chalky and sugary and was usually found buried in swamps, where it had been in contact with water for a long time. Long periods in the sun or bush fires could transform dull, cloudy lumps into higher quality transparent gum. B Virtually all kauri gum was found in the regions of New Zealand where kauri forests grow today _ from the middle of the North Island northwards. In Maori and early European times up until 1850，most gum collected was simply picked up from the ground, but, after that, the majority was recovered by digging. C The original inhabitants of New Zealand, the Maori, had experimented with kauri gum well before Europeans arrived at the beginning of the nineteenth century. They called it kapia, and found it of considerable use. Fresh gum from trees was prized for its chewing quality, as was buried gum when softened in water and mixed with the juice of a local plant. A piece of gum was often passed around from mouth to mouth when people gathered together until it was all gone, or when they tired of chewing, it was laid aside for future use. Kauri gum burns readily and was used by Maori people to light fires. Sometimes it was bound in grass, ignited and used as a torch by night fishermen to attract fish.

Reading
D The first kauri gum to be exported from New Zealand was part of a cargo taken back to Australia and England by two early expeditions in 1814 and 1815. By the 1860s, kauri gum's reputation was well established in the overseas markets and European immigrants were joining the Maoris in collecting gum on the hills of northern New Zealand. As the surface gum became more scarce, spades were used to dig up the buried 'treasure； The increasing number of diggers resulted in rapid growth of the kauri gum exports from 1,000 tons in 1860 to a maximum of over 10,000 tons in 1900. For fifty years from about 1870 to 1920, the kauri gum industry was a major source of income for settlers in northern New Zealand. As these would-be farmers struggled to break in the land, many turned to gum-digging to earn enough money to support their families and pay for improvements to their farms until better times arrived. By the 1890s，there were 20,000 people engaged in gum-digging. Although many of these, such as farmers, women and children, were only part-time diggers, nearly 7,000 were full-timers. During times of economic difficulty, gum-digging was the only job available where the unemployed from many walks of life could earn a living, if they were prepared to work. E The first major commercial use of kauri gum was in the manufacture of high-grade furniture varnish, a kind of clear paint used to treat wood. The best and purest gum that was exported prior to 1910 was used in this way. Kauri gum was used in 70% of the oil varnishes being manufactured in England in the 1890s. It was favoured ahead of other gums because it was easier to process at lower temperatures. The cooler the process could be kept the better, as it meant a paler varnish could be produced. About 1910, kauri gum was found to be a very suitable ingredient in the production of some kinds of floor coverings such as linoleum. In this way, a use was found for the vast quantities of poorer quality and less pure gum, that had up till then been discarded as waste. Kauri gum's importance in the manufacture of varnish and linoleum was displaced by synthetic alternatives in the 1930s. F Fossil kauri gum is rather soft and can be carved easily with a knife or polished with fine sandpaper. In the time of Queen Victoria of England (1837-1901)，some pieces were made into fashionable amber beads that women wore around their necks. The occasional lump that contained preserved insects was prized for use in necklaces and bracelets. Many of the gum-diggers enjoyed the occasional spell of carving and produced a wide variety of small sculptured pieces. Many of these carvings can be seen today in local museums. Over the years, kauri gum has also been used in a number of minor products, such as an ingredient in marine glue and candles. In the last decades it has had a very limited use in the manufacture of extremely high-grade varnish for violins, but the gum of the magnificent kauri tree remains an important part of New Zealand's history.

The best reason to take a gap year between school and work or higher education is to improve your CV with experience overseas. This is why some school leavers in Britain now consider a year out to be essential. Many want to travel, with Sydney the favourite destination. Shooting Star is an organisation that helps school leavers by offering training followed by appropriate employment.
We at Shooting Star offer much more than a trip abroad. At Shooting Star you acquire skills that lead to interesting jobs both for your gap year and future holidays. Magazines are full of ‘Wanted’ adverts for washing up in a restaurant. Well, we don’t do that ω it’s not our idea of excitement. We offer school leavers the chance for outdoor adventure, to teach things like sailing and snowboarding. No choice, really! In your year out you train, travel and work; you can combine work with pleasure and reap the rewards. You could become an experienced yacht skipper or instructor and many people go on to spend their future holidays being paid to enjoy their favourite sport.
Australians and New Zealanders travel to Europe and North America in large numbers to gain overseas experience. Those who qualify with Shooting Star are very soon using their skills in jobs they could only dream about before, working outdoors and seeing more of the world. Wherever you come from, a gap year with Shooting Star means professional training and international adventure.
Top tips for a successful gap year: ☆ Design your gap year in outline before applying for a permanent job or a college place. Human Resources officers or Admissions tutors will be impressed by a thought-out plan. ☆ What’s more important to you - travel or work experience? You can be flexible with travel plans but you must research job opportunities in advance. Go to our website and click on Recruitment for ideas. ☆ Who do you know who has taken a gap year before?

Succeeding at Interviews
Questions 21-27
Read the text below and answer Questions 21-27.
A Getting invited to an interview means you have passed the first hurdle - your application must have made a good impression. Now you need to prepare yourself for the interview to make sure you make the most of this opportunity. There are a number of things you can do.
B Firstly you can do some research. Find out about the employer and the job, ask for an information pack or speak to people you know who work for the company. Try to plan for the interview by asking who will be interviewing you and whether there will be a test to take.
C Prepare for questions you might be asked. Some common ones are the reason why you want the job, whether you have done this kind of work before, what your strengths and weaknesses are, and which leisure pursuits you enjoy.
D Another important point is never to run the risk of arriving late. For example, consider making a 'dummy run in advance to see how long the journey will take. Check out public transport or, if you are going by car, the nearest parking. Aim to arrive about 10 minutes before the interview is due to start.
E It is also crucial to give plenty of thought to what you are going to wear. This will depend on the job you are going for. There is no need to buy a new outfit, but aim to look neat and tidy. Remember, if you look good it will help you feel good.
F You need to make a good impression. Interviews can vary from a relatively informal ‘one-to-one chat to a very formal panel situation. Whatever the circumstances, you will give yourself an advantage by being friendly and polite, by making eye contact with the interviewer and by selling yourself by focusing on your strengths.
G There are also things you should avoid doing at your interview. First of all, don’t exaggerate. For example, if you don’t have the exact experience the employer is looking for, say so and explain you are willing to learn. Don’t simply give ‘yes ， and ‘no，answers, but answer questions as fully as you can. And lastly don’t forget to ask questions as well as answering them.
H One final thing to remember: it is important to show good team spirit, that you possess good people skills and that you are friendly and approachable. Finally, remember to be enthusiastic and show that you can be flexible.

Read the text on pages 125 and 126 and answer Questions 28-40. Serendipity 一 accidental discoveries in science What do photography, dynamite, insulin and artificial sweetener have in common? Serendipity! These diverse discoveries, which have made our everyday living more convenient, were discovered partly by chance. However, Louis Pasteur noted the additional requirement involved in serendipity when he said, chance favours only the prepared mind'. The discovery of modern photography provides an example of serendipity. In 1838, L. J. M. Daguerre was attempting to 'fix' images onto a copper photographic plate. After adding a silver coating to the plate and exposing it to iodine vapour, he found that the photographic image was improved but still very weak. Desperate after an investigation lasting several months, Daguerre placed a lightly exposed photographic plate in the cupboard in which laboratory chemicals such as alcohol and collodion were stored. To his amazement, when he removed the plate several days later, Daguerre found a strong image on its surface. This image had been created by chance. It was at this point that Louis Pasteur's 'additional requirement' came into play: Daguerre's training told him that one or more of the chemicals in the cupboard was responsible for intensifying the image. After a break of two weeks, Daguerre systematically placed new photographic plates in the cupboard, removing one chemical each day. Unpredictably, good photographic images were created even after all chemicals had been removed. Daguerre then noticed that some mercury had spilled onto the cupboard shelf, and he concluded that the mercury vapour must have improved the photographic result. From this discovery came the universal adoption of the silver-mercury process to develop photographs. Daguerre's serendipitous research effort was rewarded, a year later, with a medal conferred by the French government. Many great scientists have benefited from serendipity, including Nobel Prize winners. In fact the scientist who established the Nobel Prize was himself blessed with serendipity. In 1861, the Nobel family built a factory in Stockholm to produce nitroglycerine, a colourless and highly explosive oil that had first been prepared by an Italian chemist fifteen years earlier. Nitroglycerine was known to be volatile and unpredictable, often exploding as a result of very small knocks. But the Nobel family believed that this new explosive could solve a major problem facing the Swedish State Railways - the need to dig channels and tunnels through mountains so that the developing railway system could expand. SECTION 3 Questions 28+40 125
However, as turnover increased, so did the number of accidental explosions resulting from the use of nitroglycerine. Some people blamed the people who used the explosive more than the substance itself, because nitroglycerine had become popular for inappropriate purposes such as polishing the leather of shoes. At the age of thirty, Alfred Nobel made the first of his major inventions: an innovative blasting cap, a device designed to control the nitroglycerine explosion. Nobel was also determined to discover a way to make this explosive safer to manufacture, transport and use. Firstly, he experimented with adding chemicals to nitroglycerine, but because the chemicals required huge amounts of resources and energy to wash out, this process was considered to be impractical. He then tried to use fibrous material such as sawdust, charcoal or paper to stabilise the explosive, but these combustible materials tended to catch fire when placed near nitroglycerine. As an alternative, he added powdered brick dust to tame the explosive, as he knew that brick dust would not catch fire. However, the brick dust reduced the explosive power of the product, and so was also found to be unsatisfactory. According to one version of how the eventual solution was found, a metal container of nitroglycerine sprang a leak, and some of the liquid soaked into packaging material that lay around the container. Nobel immediately set to work to examine the connection between the two materials and found that when the packaging material was mixed with nitroglycerine it could be pressed into a compact solid. This solid retained the explosive power of the liquid, but was entirely safe and reliable because it would not ignite until set off by a blasting cap. As a scientist who had worked systematically towards a solution for a number of years, Nobel immediately understood the importance of this discovery. But the discovery had only come about because of his perseverance. Through Nobel's dear vision, systematic research and his quick grasp of the significance of his discovery, he set himself apart from the many scientists who were not 'fortunate' enough to create new products that would make them famous. Alfred Nobel, a lifelong pacifist, hoped that his explosive would be a powerful deterrent to warfare. Nobel sought to achieve permanent worldwide peace. In setting up the Nobel Foundation and the Nobel Peace Prizes, he hoped to accomplish what he had not been able to do during his lifetime: to encourage research and activities that would bestow the 'greatest benefit to mankind', especially peace and fraternity between nations. His vision was of a peaceful world.

Could I have your name please? Andrea Brown. Thank you. And your address? 24, Ardleiah Road. Can you spell that? A-R-D-L-E-l-G-H Road. Postcode? BH520P Thanks. And can I have your phone number? Is a mobile alright? Fine. It’s 07786643091. Thank you. And can I ask you where you heard about World Tours? From a friend? Or did you see an advert somewhere? No, I read about you in the newspaper. OK, I’ll get the brochures in the post to you but can I give you some information over the phone. What kinds of things do you want to do on your holiday? i’m interested in going to California with my family. I’ve got two children and we want to hire a car. OK. We have a couple of self-drive tours there visiting different places of interest in California. The first one begins in Los Angeles and there’s plenty of time to visit some of the theme parks there. That’s something on my children’s list so I’d want to include that. Good. Then you drive to San Francisco. From San Francisco you can drive to Yosemite Park where you spend a couple of nights. You can choose to stay in a lodge or on the campsite. I don’t like the idea of staying in a tent. It~d be too hot. Right. And the tour ends in Las Vegas. OK. The other trip we can arrange is slightly different. It starts in San Francisco. Then you drive south to Cambria. Someone told me there’s a really nice castle near Cambria. Will we go near that? Hearst Castle is on that road so you could stop there. Good. I’d like to do that. Does this trip also go into the desert? No, it continues to Santa Monica where most people like to stop and do some shopping. We have enough of that at home so that doesn’t interest us.

So how many days are the trips and how much do they cost? The first one I told you about is a self-drive tour through California which lasts twelve days and covers 2.020 kilometres. The shortest journey is Q7 206 km and the longest is 632 kilometres. The cost is £525 per person. That includes accommodation, car rental and a flight but no meals. Q8 OK. And the other trip? That lasts nine days but you spend only three days on the road. You cover about 980 kilometres altogether. So is that cheaper then? Yes, it’s almost a hundred pounds cheaper. It’s £429 per person, which is Q9 a good deal. So that covers accommodation and car hire. What about flights? They aren’t included. But these hotels offer dinner in the price. Q10 OK. Well, thank you very much. I’ll be in touch when I’ve had a chance to look at the brochure. I’m pleased to help. Goodbye. Goodbye.
SECTION 2 On behalf of LP Clubs, l~d like to welcome you all here today. My name’s Sandy Fisher and I’m one of the fitness managers here. Before we start our tour of the club l~ ll just run through some basic information about the facilities we have here, including recent improvements, and explain the types of membership available. Our greatest asset is probably our swimming pool which at 25 metres isn’t Olvmpic-sized. Q11 & 12 but now we’ve expanded it to eight lanes, it’s much wider. 丁his means there are rarely more than a couple of people at a time in each lane. Unfortunately, there isn’t space for an outdoor pool here but the glass roof on the swimming pool is partly retractable, which means you can enjoy something of the open-air experience on warmer days. Our recently refurbished fitness suite has all the latest exercise equipment including ten Q11 & 12 new running machines, and a wide range of weight-training machines. Each member is given full training in how to operate the equipment and there is always a trainer on duty to offer help and advice. Although we do have adult-only times after 6 and at certain times at weekends, children are well catered for. Older children continue to benefit from a wide range of tuition; anything from trampolining to yoga.
One thing all our members appreciate about us is that we take very good care of them. This starts on day one with your personal assessment. You are asked to fill in a questionnaire giving details of anv health problems. One of our personal trainers will then go through this with you. The trainer will then take vou through the safety rules for using the equipment in the fitness suite. During your next exercise session a personal trainer will work with you to make sure you understand these. It~s very important to do this because we really do want to avoid

having any sports injuries. There’s a lot more to looking after yourself than simply lifting weights! At the end of the personal assessment, the trainer will draw up a plan, outlining what you should trv to achieve within a six-week period. This will then be reviewed at the end of the six weeks. Now, I’ll just quickly run through the types of membership we have available. All members must oav a joining fee of £90 in addition to the rates for the monthly membership fees. Gold membership entitles vou to free entry at all LP Clubs. There are now LP clubs in all major cities and towns so if you travel a lot this will be a great advantage. Individual gold membership costs £50 a month and joint membership for you and your partner will cost £75. Premier membership is for professional people whose work commitments make it difficult for them to use the club during the day and so LP gives booking preferences to Premier members at peak times. This means you will find it easier to book the sessions at times that suit you. Reciprocal arrangements with other LP Clubs are available to Premier members. Premier membership is for individuals only, but vou will be sent passes for quests every month. The monthly fee is £65. You don’t have to have any special clothes or equipment when you visit the club. We provide robes and hairdryers in the changing rooms, but it’s very important to remember vour Dhoto card because you won’t be able to get in without it. For people who aren’t working during the day then ...

Come in and tell me about it. What sort of competition is it? Well, it’s an international design competition and we have to come up with a new design for a typical domestic kitchen appliance. I see, and are there any special conditions? Does it have to save energy for example? Actually that was the focus in last year’s competition. This year’s different.

Well,丨 decided to choose the dishwasher. Interesting, what made you choose that? Well, they’re an everyday kitchen appliance in most Australian houses but they’re all pretty boring and almost identical to each other. I think some people will be prepared to pav a little extra for something that looks different. That’s a nice idea. I see you~ve called your design ‘the Rockpool’； why is that?

Actually it does have a function. Instead of pushing a button, vou turn Q23 the stone. So it’s really just a novel way of starting the dishwasher. That’s right. It~s a really nice design, but what makes it innovative? Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses carbon dioxide. In place of water and detergent? How will you manage that? The idea is to pressurise the carbon dioxide so that it becomes a liquid. The fluid is then released into the dishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself. Sounds like a brilliant idea! Your system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents. So what happens once the dishes are clean? Well, to allow them to dry, the liquid carbon dioxide and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding chamber. That’s where the Q24 liquid is depressurised and so it reverts to a aas. Then the oil and grease are separated out and sent to the waste system. It sounds like you’ve thought it all out very thoroughly. So, what happens to the carbon dioxide once the process is complete? Not wasted I hope. Actually, that’s where the real savings are made. The carbon dioxide is Q25 sent back to the cylinder and can be used again and again. What a terrific idea. Do you think it will ever be built? Probably not, but that’s OK. Well, I’m sure a lot of positive things will come out of your design.
Now, you seem to have thought about everything so what exactly did you need me to help you with? Well, my design has made it to the final stage of the competition and, in a Q26 few months’ time.

Well, I’ve got detailed drawings to show how it will work and I’ve also written a 500-word paper on it. I see. Well, if vou want to stand a good chance of winning vou really need Q27 a model of the machine. Yes, I thought I might but I’m having a few problems. What is the main difficulty so far? Let me guess - is it the materials? Yes. 丨 want it to look professional but everything that’s top quality is also Q28 very expensive. Look, projects like this are very important to us. They really help lift our profile. So whv don't vou talk to the university about a grant? I can help Q29 you fill out the application forms if you like. That would be great. You~d better show me this paper vou’ve written as well. For a global Q30 competition such as this vou need to make sure the technical details vouVe given are accurate and thorough. That would be a great help. Is there anything else I can do? Well, I’m really ...

SECTION 4 Today we continue our series on ecology and conservation with a look at a particularly endangered member of the black bear family. One in ten black bears is actually born with a white coat, which is the result of a special aene that surfaces in a few. Local people have named it ‘the spirit bear’. And according to the leaends of these communities, its snowv fur brings with it a special power. Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them 一 so much that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else. It is their wav of protecting it when strangers visit the area. The white bear’s habitat is quite interesting. The bear’s strong relationship with the old- growth rainforest is a complex one. The white bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways. For example, the old-arowth trees have extremely Iona roots that help prevent erosion of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams. Keeping these banks intact is important because these streams are home to salmon, which are the bear’s main food source. In return, the bear’s feeding habits nurture the forest. As the bears eat the salmon, they discard the skin and bones in great amounts on the forest floor, which provide vital nutrients. These produce lush vegetation that sustains thousands of other types of life forms, from birds to insects and more. Today, the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few islands. There is great concern for their survival since it is estimated that less than two hundred of these white bears remain. The best way to protect them is to make every effort to preserve the delicate balance of their forest environment - in other words, their ecosystem.
The greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of its habitat. Over many years, logging companies have stripped the land by cutting down a large number of trees. In addition, they have built roads which have fractured the areas where the bear usually feeds, and many hibernation sites have also been lost. The logging of the trees along the streams has damaged the places where the bears fish. To make matters worse, the number of salmon in those streams is declining because there is no legal limit on fishing at the moment. All these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear’s very existence, which is made all the more fragile bv the fact that reproduction among these bears has always been disappointingly low. And so, what’s the situation going forward? Community organizations, environmental groups and the British Columbia government are now working together on the problem. The government is now requiring logging companies to adopt a better loaaina method, which is a positive step. However, these measures alone may not be sufficient to ensure a healthy population of the spirit bear in the future. Other steps also need to be taken. While it is important to maintain the spirit bear's habitat, there also needs to be more emphasis on its expansion. 丁he move is justified as it will also create space for other bears that are losing their homes ...

Excuse me. Yes? I wonder if you could spare a few minutes to do a survey on transport. It won’t take long. No, that’s fine. Lovely. The survey is on behalf of the local council. They’d like to know about what transport you use and any suggestions for improvement. Can I start by asking you how you travelled to town today? Sure. I came on the bus. Great. Now can I get a few details about yourself? OK. What’s your name? It’s Luisa .... Yes. Hardie. Can you spell that, please? Yes, it’s H-A-R-D-l-E. Great. Thanks. And can I have your address? It’s 19, White Stone Road. Oh, right. I know that area. It’s Bradfield, isn’t it? That’s right. Is the postcode GT7? It s actually G-T-8. 2-L-C. Great. And could I ask what your job is? Are you a student? I’ve actually just finished my training. I’m a hairdresser. Oh, right. And one more question in this section. What is the reason for you coming into town today? Actually ti ~s not for shopping today, which would be my normal reason, but to see the dentist. Right. Thanks. 1
Now in this last section l~d like you to give us some ideas about the facilities and arrangements in the city for getting to and from work, er~any suggestions you have for improvements. Well, something l~ve thought about for some time is that when I do walk and I’m doing a later shift~I think the lighting should be better. Yes, good point. And of course, I think ti ~s a real shame they’ve been cutting down on the number of footpaths. They should have more of those. Then people would walk more. Yes, right. And, I don’t think there are enough trains. That’s why I don’t use them - vou have to wait so long. Thanks. And finally I’d like to ask your opinion on cycling. As you may know, there’s a drive in the city to get more people to cycle to work.

Right. But we realise that there are things which the council, but also employers, might do to help encourage workers to cycle to work. Yep. Well, I have thought about it and where I work there are no safe places to leave vour bikes. OK. And also, I’d have to cycle uphill and on a hot day I’d arrive at work pretty sweaty so 1 think I’d need a shower somewhere at work. Right. And I suppose the last thing is that I wouldn’t be all that confident about cycling on such busy roads. I think l~d like to see vou offering training for that, you know, l~d feel a lot better about starting if that was the case. Well, that’s very helpful. Thank you very much for your time. No problem. Bye.
SECTION 2 Good morning. I’m very pleased to have this opportunity to say a little about two exciting new developments in the city: the Brackenside Open-Air Swimming Pool and the children’s Adventure Playground in Central Park. As many of you may know, the idea for these initiatives came from vou. the public, in the extensive consultation exercise which the City Council conducted last year. And they have been realised using money from the SWRDC - the South West Regional Development Commission. First of all, Brackenside Pool. As many of the older members of the audience will remember, there used to be a wonderful open-air pool on the sea front 30 years ago but it had to close when it was judged to be unsafe. For the design of this new heated pool, we were very happy to secure the talents of internationally renowned architect 曰 len Wendon, who has managed to combine a charming 1930s design, which fits in so well with many of the other buildings in the area, with up-to-the-minute features such as a recycling system - the only one of its kind in the world - which enables seawater to be used in the pool. Now, there has been quite a bit of discussion in the local press about whether there would be enough room for the number of visitors we’re hoping to attract, but the design is deceptive and there have been rigorous checks about capacity. Also, just in case you were wondering, we're on schedule for a June 15th opening date and well within budget: a testimony to the excellent work of local contractors Hickman’s. We hope that as many people as possible will be there on June 15th. We have engaged award-winning actress Coral White to declare the pool open and there ~" be drinks and snacks available at the pool side. There’ll also be a competition for the public to decide on the sculpture we plan to have at the entrance: vou will decide which famous historical figure from the citv we should have.
And now, moving on to the Central Park Playground, which we’re pleased to announce has just won the Douglas Award for safety: the news came through only last week. The unique design is based on the concept of the Global Village, with the playground being divided into six areas showing different parts of the world - each with a representative feature. For example, there is a section on Asia, and this is represented bv rides and equipment in the shape of snakes, orang-utans, tiaers and so on - fauna native to the forests of the region. Moving south to the Antarctic - we couldn’t run to an ice rink I’m afraid but opted instead

for climbing blocks in the shape of mountains 一 I thought they could have had slides for the glaciers but the designers did want to avoid being too literal! Then on to South America - and here the theme is El Dorado - games replicating the search for mines full of precious stones. And then moving up to North America, here there was considerable debate - I know the contribution of cinema and jazz was considered but the designers finally opted for rockets and the International Space Station. Eastwards to Europe then, and perhaps the most traditional choice of all the areas: medieval castles and other fortifications. Then last, but not least, moving south to Africa and a whole set of wonderful mosaics and trails to represent the great rivers of this fascinating and varied continent. Now, the opening date for our Global Playground is 10th July. And again we~d love to see you there - so make a date and come and see this magnificent, original new amenity right in the heart of the city.
SECTION 3 victor： Right, well, for our presentation shall I start with the early life of Thor Heyerdahl? olivia： Sure. Why don’t you begin with describing the type of boy he was, especially his passion for collecting things. victor： That’s right, he had his own little museum. And I think it’s unusual for children to develop their own values and not join in their parents’ hobbies; l~m thinking of how Heyerdahl wouldn’t go hunting with his dad, for example. olivia： Y e a h ,

 t o g e t h e r , t h e y decided to experience living on a small island, to find out how harsh weather conditions shaped people's lifestyles. victor： As part of their preparation before they left home, they learnt basic survival skills like building a shelter. I guess they needed that knowledge in order to live wild in a remote location with few inhabitants, cut off by the sea, which is what they were aiming to do. olivia： An important part of your talk should be the radical theory Heyerdahl formed from examining mysterious ancient carvings that he happened to find on the island. I think you should finish with that. victor： O K.
olivia： All right, Victor, so after your part l~ ll talk about Thor Heyerdahl’s adult life, continuing from the theory he had about Polynesian migration. Up until that time of course, academics had believed that humans first migrated to the islands in Polynesia from Asia, in the west. victor： Yes, they thought that travel from the east was impossible, because of the huge, empty stretch of ocean that lies between the islands and the nearest inhabited land. olivia： Yes, but Heyerdahl spent ages studying the cloud movements, ocean currents and wind patterns to find if it was actually possible. And another

argument was that there was no tradition of large ship-building in the communities lying to the east of Polynesia. But Heyerdahl knew they made lots of coastal voyages in locally built canoes. victor： Yes, or sailing on rafts, as was shown by the long voyage that Heyerdahl did next. It was an incredibly risky journey to undertake ︼ sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private reasons, you know? To show others that he could have spectacular adventures. What do you think, Olivia? Olivia： W ell, I think it was more a matter of simolv trying out his idea, to see if migration from the east was possible. victor： Yes, that’s probably it. And the poor guy suffered a bit at that time because the war forced him to stop his work for some years ... olivia： Yes. When he got started again and planned his epic voyage, do you think it was important to him that he achieve it before anyone else did? victor： Um, I haven’t read anywhere that that was his motivation. The most important factor seems to have been that he use only ancient techniques and local materials to build his raft. olivia： Y es. I wonder how fast it went. victor： Well, it took them 97 days from South America to the Pacific Islands. olivia： Mm. And after that, Heyerdahl went to Easter Island, didn’t he? We should mention the purpose of that trip. I think he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds. victor： No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia. olivia： Oh, yes, that’s right. victor： But what he wanted to do was talk to the local people about their old stone carvings and then make one himself to learn more about the process. olivia： I see. Well, what a great life. Even though many of his theories have been disproven, he certainly left a lasting impression on many disciplines, didn’t he? To mv mind, he was the first person to establish what modern academics call practical archaeology. I mean, that they try to recreate something from the oast today, like he did with his raft trip. It’s unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians originated from have been completely discredited. victor： Yes. Right, well, I’ll prepare a PowerPoint slide at the end that acknowledges our sources. I mainly used The Life and Work of Thor Heyerdahl by William Oliver. I thought the research methods he used were very sound, although I must sav I found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned. I think they need to do a new, revised edition. olivia： Y e a h ,

One area I want to mention is business markets, and l~m sure a really significant development will be a major increase in competition, with companies from all round the world trying to sell similar products. Consumers will have much more choice - for instance, food products sold in Australia might be manufactured in the USA, China, Finland and dozens of other countries. At the same time, mergers and takeovers mean that governments are actually losing power to major global corporations. We can probably all think of companies that exert a great deal of influence, which may be good for consumers. A third point I want to make about markets is that in the rapidly expanding economies, such as India. China. Brazil and Russia, demand is growing very fast. This is putting pressure on resources all over the world. I think businesses are becoming more open to external influences. In particular, companies are consulting customers more and more before making their business decisions. Companies are finding out what they want and providing it, instead of making products and then trying to sell them, which is the model of years ago. Another influence is that concerns about the environment will force manufacturers to extend product lifecycles, to reduce the amount of pollution and waste. And in some cases, regulation will need to be strengthened. Many societies are much more fluid and democratic, and the structure of companies is changing to reflect that. I think we~ re going to see a greater emphasis within companies on teams created with a specific project in mind. And when they’re completed, the teams will be disbanded and new ones formed. More and more people see work as simply one part of their lifestyle, and not the most important one, and as the workforce is shrinking in some countries, businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being able to choose among a lot of applicants. Typical examples that will attract and retain staff are traditional ones like flexible hours and - something that has been made possible by advances in technology 一 remote working, with people based at their home, abroad, or almost anywhere they choose.
Management styles will almost certainly continue to change. Senior managers will require a lot more than the efficiency that they’ve always needed. Above all thevll need great skills in leadership, so that their organisation can initiate and respond to change in a fast-moving world, where they face lots of competing requirements and potential conflicts. In most of the world, the senior managers of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties. The predominant stvle of management will almost certainly become more consultative and collaborative, caused above all, bv more women moving into senior management positions. Many of the changes are influenced by developments in the wider economy. The traditional emphasis of business was manufacturing, and of course the service sector is very important. But we shouldn’t overlook the growing financial contribution of IP, that is, intellectual property. Some books and films generate enormous sums from the sale of related DVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on. Another point l~d like to make is that although I’ve been talking about companies, one trend that they have to face is the move away from people working for the same employer for years. Instead, more and more people are becoming self-emoloved. to gain the freedom and control over their lives that they’re unlikely to get from being employed. OK, well that’s all I want to say, so let’s open it up for discussion.

Good morning. Welcome to the Early Learning Childcare Centre. How may I help you? Hi. I spoke to you last week about enrolling my daughter for next year. Oh, yes. I’ll just get some details from you. So, you’re her mother? That’s right. And, can I have your name? It’s Carol, Carol Smith. And your daughter’s name? It’s Kate. Now, we have several groups at the centre and we cater for children from three to five years old. How old is your daughter? She~s three now but she turns four next month. I’ll put four down because that’s how old she’ll be when she starts. Fine, she’s so excited about her birthday and coming to the centre. That’s good to hear. And what’s your address? It’s 46 Wombat Road, that’s W-O-M-B-A-T. Woodside 4032. And what’s the phone number? Oh ... it’s ... 3345 9865. So, have you decided on the days you'd like to bring your daughter here? I’d prefer Monday and Wednesday if possible. Mmm. I’ll check, Monday’s fine, but I think the centre is already full for Wednesday. Erm. Yes. Sorry. It seems to be a very popular day. We can offer you a Thursday or a Friday as well. Oh dear. I suppose Thursday would be all right because she has swimming on Friday. OK, got that. Because a lot of parents work, we do offer flexible start and finish times. We are open from 7:30 in the morning until 6 o’clock at night. What time would you like your daughter to start? I need to get to work in the city by 9:00 so i'll drop her off at 8:30. You’re pretty close to the city here so that should give me plenty of time to get there. That’s fine. Now, we also need to decide which group she’ll be in. We have two different groups and they’re divided up according to age. There’s the green group, which is for three- to four-year-olds. And then there’s the red group which is for four- to five-year-olds. She's quite mature for her age and she can already write her name and read a little. Well, I’ll put her in the red group and we can always change her to the green one if there are any problems. That sounds fine. OK. Let’s move on to meals. We can provide breakfast, lunch and dinner. As she's finishing pretty early, she won’t need dinner, will you give her breakfast before she comes? Yes, she’ll onlv need lunch.

Now, does she have any medical conditions we need to know about? Does she have asthma or any hearing problems for example? No. But she does need to wear glasses. Q7 Oh, ril make a note of that. Yes, she's pretty good about wearing them, she can~t see much without them. Right. OK. Now, I also need emergency contact details. So what sort of information do you need? Just the name and number of a friend or family member we can contact in case we can’t get hold of you at any time. OK. That’d better be my sister... Jenny Ball. That’s B-A-double L. Her Q8 phone number is 3346 7523. Great. So she is the child’s aunt? Q9 Yes, that’s right. Ill make a note of that as well. Now, is there anything you~d like to ask? What about payment? How much are the fees each term? Well, for two days and the hours you’ve chosen, that will be $450 altogether. OK, and do I have to pay that now? No, we send out invoices once the children start at the centre. You can choose to pay at the end of each term or we do offer a slightly discounted rate if vou oav every month. Oh. ril do that then. I find it easier to budget that way and l~m not used to Q10 the term dates just yet. Good, it makes it a lot simpler for us as well. Well, that’s everything. Would you like me to show you around ？ 2 Today we*re pleased to have on the show Alice Bussell from the Dolphin Conservation Trust. Tell us about the Trust, Alice. Well, obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all around the world. It tries to raise people’s awareness of the problems these marine creatures are suffering because of pollution and other threats. It started ten years ago and it’s one of the fastest growing animal charities in the country - although it’s still fairly small compared with the big players in animal protection. We are particularly proud of the work we do in education - last year we visited a huge number of schools in different parts of the country, going round to talk to children and young people aged from five to eighteen. In fact, about thirty-five per cent of our members are children. The charity uses its money to support campaigns Q11 & 12 - for example, for changes in fishing policy and so forth. It hopes soon to be able to employ its first full-time biologist 一 with dolphin expertise - to monitor populations. Of course, many people give their services on a voluntary basis and we now have volunteers working in observation, office Q11 & 12 work and other things. I should also tell you about the award we won from the Charity Commission last year 一 for our work in education. Although it’s not meant an enormous amount of money for us~it has made our activities even Q13 more widely publicised and understood. In the long term it may not bring in extra members but we’re hoping it’ll have this effect. 141

interviewer： Is it possible to see dolphins in UK waters? alice： Yes. In several locations. And we have a big project in the east part of Scotland. This has long been a haven for dolphins because it has very little shipping. However, that may be about to change soon because oil companies want to increase exploration there. We’re campaigning against this because, although there’ll be little pollution from oil, exploration creates a lot of underwater noise. It means the dolphins can’t rest and socialise. This is how I became interested in dolphin conservation in the first place. I had never seen one and I hadn’t been particularly interested in them at school. Then I came across this storv about a family of dolphins who had to leave their home in the Moray Firth because of the oil companies and about a child who campaigned to save them. I couldn’t out the book down - 1 was hooked.
I’m sure our listeners will want to find out what they can do to help. You mentioned the ‘Adopt a Dolphin’ scheme. Can you tell us about that? Of course! People can choose one of our dolphins to sponsor. They receive a picture of it and news updates. I~d like to tell you about four which are currently being adopted by our members: Moondancer, Echo, Kiwi and Samson. Unfortunately, Echo is being rather elusive this year and hasn’t vet been sighted bv our observers but we remain optimistic that he'll be out there soon. All the others have been out in force - Samson and Moondancer are often photographed together but it is Kiwi who~ s our real ‘character~as she seems to love coming up dose for the cameras and we’ve captured her on film hundreds of times. They all have their own personalities - Moondancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly, whereas Samson has a lot of energy - he’s always 丨 eaDina out of the water with great vigour. You’d probably expect him to be the youngest 一 he’s not quite 一 that’s Kiwi - but Samson’s the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the scheme. Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straightaway. Echo and Moondancer are noisy too, but Moondancer’s easy to find because she has a particularly 丨 arae fin on her back, which makes her easy to identify. So, yes, they’re all very different...

OK, but how? Did you talk to him about it? He must have all sorts of stories, but he never says much about his work, even now. He has a sort of authority though. So how did you manage to capture that? I~d ... I’d visualise what he must have been like in the oast, when he was Q21 sitting in his consuitina room listening to his patients. OK, so that’s what you explain in your report. Right. Then there’s the issue of atmosphere 一 so in the first scene we needed to know how boring life was in the doctor’s village in the 1950s, so when the curtain went up on the first scene in the waiting room, there was that long silence before anyone spoke. And then people kept saving the same thing Q22 over and over, like ‘Cold, isn’t it?’ Yes, and everyone wore grey and brown, and just sat in a row. Yes, all those details of the production. And I have to analyse how I functioned in the group 一 what I found out about myself. I know I was so frustrated at times, when we couldn't agree. Yes. So did one person emerge as the leader? Sophia did. That was OK - she helped us work out exactly what to do. for Q23 the production. And that made me feel better. I suppose. When you understood what needed doing? Yes. And Sophia did some research, too. That was useful in developing our approach. Like what? Well, she found these articles from the 1950s about how relationships Q24 between children and their parents, or between the public and people like bank managers or the police were shifting. Interesting. And did you have any practical problems to overcome? Well, in the final rehearsal everything was going fine until the last scene 一 that’s where the doctor’s first patient appears on stage on his own. The one in the wheelchair? Yes, and he had this really long speech, with the stage all dark except for one spotlight 一 and then that stuck somehow so it was shining on the Q25 wrong side of the stage ... but anyway we got that fixed, thank goodness. Yes, it was fine on the night.
But while you’re here, Mia, I wanted to ask you about the year abroad option. Would you recommend doing that? Yes, definitely. It’s a fantastic chance to study in another country for a year. I think I’d like to do it, but it looks very competitive - there’s only a limited number of places. Yes, so next year when vou are in the second year of the course, vou Q26 need to work really hard in all vour theatre studies modules. Only students with good marks get places - vou have to prove that vou know vour subject really well. Right. So how did you choose where to go? Well. | decided I wanted a programme that would fit in with what I wanted Q27 to do after I graduate, so I looked for a university with emphasis on acting rather than directing for example. It depends on vou. Then about six months before you go, you have to email the scheme coordinator with

your top three choices. I had a friend who missed the deadline and didn’t get her first choice, so vou do need to get a move on at that stage. You~ " find that certain places are very popular with everyone. 
rob： And don’t you have to write a personal statement at that stage? mia： Yes. rob： Right. I’ll get some of the final year students to give me some tips . • • maybe see if I can read what they wrote. mia： I think that’s a very good idea. I don~t mind showing you what I did. And while vou~ re abroad don’t make the mistake I made. I aot so involved I forgot all about making arrangements for when I came back here for the final year. Make sure vou stay in touch so they know vour choices for the optional modules. You don’t want to miss out doing your preferred specialisms. rob： Right.
SECTION 4 Today, 丨 want to talk about self-regulatory focus theory and how the actions of leaders can affect the way followers approach different situations. Self-regulatory focus theory is a theory developed by Tori Higgins. He says that a person’s focus at any given time is to either approach pleasure or avoid pain. These are two basic motivations that each and every one of us has, and they cause us to have different kinds of goals. Promotion goals in different life situations emphasise achievement. Prevention goals are oriented towards the avoidance of punishment. In a specific situation, our thoughts might focus more on promotion goals or more on prevention goals. The theory suggests that two factors affect which goals we are focusing on. First, there is a chronic factor. This factor is connected to a person’s personality and says that each person has a basic tendency to either focus more on promotion goals or focus more on prevention goals as part of his or her personality. Second, there is a situational factor which means that the context we are in can make us more likely to focus on one set of goals or the other. For example, we are more likely to be thinking about pleasure and to have promotion goals when we are spending time with a friend. In contrast, if we are working on an important project for our boss, we are more likely to try to avoid making mistakes and therefore have more prevention goals in our mind. Research has shown that the goals we are focusing on at a given time affect the way we think. For example, when focusing on promotion goals, people consider their idea丨 self. their aspirations and gains. They don’t think about what they can lose, so they think in a happier mode. They feel more inspired to change. When people are focusing on prevention goals, they think about their “ought” self. What are they supposed to be? What are people expecting from them? They consider their obligations to others. As a result, they experience more anxiety and try to avoid situations where they could lose.
Now that I have talked about the two focuses and how they affect people, I want to look at the idea that the wav leaders behave, or their style of leading, can affect the focus that followers adopt in a specific situation. In talking about leadership, we often mention transformational leaders and transactional leaders. Transformational leaders, when interacting with their followers, focus on their development. In their words and actions

Test 4
transformational leaders highlight change. Their speech is passionate and conveys a definitive vision. All of these things can encourage followers to think about what could be. In other words, they inspire a promotion focus in their followers. In contrast, transactional leaders focus on developing clear structures that tell their followers exactly what is expected of them. While they do explain the rewards people will get for following orders, they emphasise more how a follower will be punished or that a follower won’t get rewarded if his or her behaviour doesn’t change. In short, they emphasise the consequences of making a mistake. This emphasis will clearly lead followers to focus on avoiding punishment and problems. This is clearly a prevention focus. In conclusion, it is important to understand that one focus is not necessarily better than the other one. For a designer who works in a field where a lot of innovation is needed, a promotion focus is probably better. In contrast, a prevention focus which causes people to work more cautiously and produce higher quality work might be very appropriate for a job like a surgeon, for example. The main point of the research, though, is that the actions of leaders can greatly influence whether people approach a situation with more of a promotion focus or more of a prevention focus.

SECTION 2 Welcome to Manham Port, where a thousand years of history are brought to life. All the family can enjoy a day out at Manham: visit our copper mine, see models of the machinery it used, have your photo taken in nineteenth-century costume, experience at first hand how people lived at different stages throughout history, and especially how children studied, worked and played. The port of Manham is located in beautiful and peaceful countryside, on a bend in the great River Avon, and developed here because it’s the highest navigable point of the Avon - boats can go no higher up this river - and proved a handv place to load and unload cargo to and from the sea, which is over 23 miles away. A small port was already

established here when, about 900 years ago, tin was discovered nearby, though it wasn’t until the Industrial Revolution, when a tremendous need for metals of all kinds developed, that Manham expanded to become one of the busiest ports in the country. And because it was already so busy, prospectors began to look for other minerals, and by the end of the nineteenth century, lead, copper, manganese and arsenic were added to the cargos leaving Manham. In the early days, the ores had been smelted - or processed 一 in the same area they were mined. But, as demand grew, the smelting process required huge factory furnaces or fires to melt the metal from the rock and there was not enough coal in the local area, so the rocks containing minerals had to be shipped Iona distances. Sadly, in the twentieth century, the great port of Manham declined, and thousands of workers were forced to emigrate out of the area. The building at the port fell into disrepair, and the place became almost forgotten. But then, the Manham Trust was formed to conserve the historical resources of the area. It organised scores of local volunteers to remove undergrowth to find the original outlines of the installations. It then brought in paid professionals to match installations with maps of the original port complex and to set about reconstructing it. Today you can see the results of this ambitious programme of restoration. The intention, and we believe this will be realised before the end of the year, is to return Manham Port to the condition it reached at its peak as ‘the greatest copper port in the country~ .
But what can you do and see on your visit today? Here are just a few highlights. We suggest you start with the visit to the copper mine. Travel on converted mining trains and journey into the depths of the mountain along seams once worked bv hundreds of miners. Watch out especially for the great pumping machines which rid the mine of water. But please be warned that, like all mines, ours is very dark and closed in and we do sav that children under five and also doas should NOT be taken into the mine. The next recommended visit is to the village school. While 丨 ookina round the classrooms. take a special look at our display of games, which is one of the 丨 araest in the world. And it’s recommended that vou time vour visit to coincide with a guided tour. This will give you the opportunity to ask lots of questions. Near the school is the beautiful old sailing ketch called The George’. You are welcome to board the boat and look round the cabins. Look out for the ship’s wheel which was missing until only five years ago when it was dredged out of the silt by a local fisherman. We have no idea how it got there but it’s been polished and proudly restored to its original place on the boat. Please take care going down the ladders if vou wish to visit the lower deck - we don’t recommend vou allow vouna children to use them. So we hope you have a memorable visit to Manham Port and will tell your friends all about us.

someone to produce a company brochure, and I wanted to get some business experience because I’m interested in a career in occupational psychology in a business environment. It was good because I had overall responsibility for the project. What kind of skills do you think you developed on the placement? I mean, apart from the ones you already had ... Did you have to do all the artwork for the brochure, the layout and everything? We hired the services of a professional photographer for that. I did have to use my IT skills to a certain extent because I cut and pasted text from marketing leaflets, but that didn’t involve anything I hadn’t done before. Do vou think you got anv better at managing vour time and prioritising things? You always used to sav vou had trouble with that... Oh. definitely. There was so much pressure to meet the project deadline. And I also got better at explaining things and asserting mv opinions, because I had to have weekly consultations with the marketing manager and give him a progress report. It sounds as if you got a lot out of it then. Absolutely. It was really worthwhile ... But you know, the company benefited too "• Yes, they must have done. After all, if they’d used a professional advertising agency to produce their brochure instead of doing it in-house, presumably they~d have paid a lot more? Oh, yes. I worked it out - it would have been 250 per cent more. And I thought the end result was good, even though we did everything on site. The company has quite a powerful computer and I managed to borrow some scanning software from the university. The new brochure looks really professional; it enhances the imaae of the company straight awav. So in the long run it should help them to attract clients, and improve their sales figures? That’s the idea. Yeah.
Well, all in all it sounds very positive 一 I think I will go ahead and apply for a placement myself. How do I go about it? It~s easy enough to do, because there’s a government agency called STEP - S-T-E-P 一 that organises placements for students. You should start by getting their booklet with all the details - I expect you can download one from their website. Actually, thevVe got copies in the psvcholoav department - I’ve seen them there. I’ll iust go to the office and Dick one up. Right. And then if I were you, after I’d looked at it I’d go over all the options with someone • •. I suppose I should ask my tutor’s advice. He knows more about me than anyone. One of the career officers would be better, they’ve got more knowledge about the jobs market than your personal tutor would have. OK ... And then when you know what you want you can register with STEP - you~" find their address in the booklet. And once you’ve registered they assign you to a mentor who looks after your application. And then I suppose you just sit back and wait till you hear something? They told me at the careers office that it’s best to be proactive, and get

updates vourself bv checking the website for new placement alerts. Your mentor is supposed to keep you informed, but you can’t rely on that. 
tim： I don’t suppose it ~ s a good idea to get in touch with companies directly, is it? Laura： Not really ... But it is the company who notifies vou if they want vou to go for an interview. You get a letter of invitation or an email from personnel departments. tim： A n d

 Μ replv directly to them? laura： Yes, vou do. STEP only gets involved again once you’ve been made a job offer. tim： Right • • • So. once vouVe had an interview vou should let vour mentor know what the outcome is? I mean whether vou’re offered a job, and whether vouVe decided to accept it? laura： That’s right. They’ll inform the careers office once a placement has been agreed, so you don’t have to do that. tim： i s

SECTION 4 Today we，re going to look at an important area of science, namely nanotechnology. So what is it? Nano means tiny, so it's science and engineering on the scale of atoms and molecules. The idea is that by controlling and rearranging atoms, you can literally create anything. However, as we’ll see~the science of the small has some big implications affecting us in many ways. There’s no doubt that nanotechnology promises so much for civilisation. However, all new technologies have their teething problems. And with nanotechnology, society often gets the wrong idea about its capabilities. Numerous science-fiction books and movies have raised people’s fears about nanotechnology - with scenarios such as inserting little nano-robots into your body that monitor everything you do without you realising it~or self-replicating nano-robots that eventually take over the world. So how do we safeguard such a potentially powerful technology? Some scientists recommend that nano-particles be treated as new chemicals with separate safety tests and clear labelling. They believe that greater care should also be taken with nano-particles in laboratories and factories. Others have called for a withdrawal of new nano products such as cosmetics and a temporary halt to many kinds of nanotech research. But as far as I’m concerned there’s a need to plough ahead with the discoveries and applications of nanotechnology. I really believe that most scientists would welcome a way to guard against unethical uses of such technology. We can’t go around thinking that all innovation is bad, all advancement is bad. As with the debate about any new technology, it is how you use it that’s important. So let’s look at some of its possible uses.
Q28

Thanks to nanotechnology, there could be a major breakthrough in the field of transportation with the production of more durable metals. These could be virtually unbreakable, lighter and much more pliable leading to planes that are 50 times lighter than at present. Those same improved capabilities will dramatically reduce the cost of travelling into space making it more accessible to ordinary people and opening up a totally new holiday destination. In terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to shrink computer parts down to minute sizes. We need nanotechnology in order to create a new aeneratio门 of computers that will work even faster and will have a million times more memory but will be about the size of a suaar cube. Nanotechnology could also revolutionise the way that we generate power. The cost of solar cells will be drastically reduced so harnessing this energy will be far more economical than at present. But nanotechnology has much wider applications than this and could have an enormous impact on our environment. For instance, tiny airborne nano-robots could be programmed to actually rebuild the ozone layer, which could lessen the impact of global warming on our planet. That’s a pretty amazing thought, isn’t it? On a more local scale, this new technology could help with the clean-up of environmental disasters as nanotechnoioav will allow us to remove oil and other contaminants from the water far more effectively. And, if nanotechnology progresses as expected - as a sort of building block set of about 90 atoms - then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up. In terms of production, this means that vou only use what vou need and so there wouldn’t be anv waste. The notion that you could create anything at all has major implications for our health. It means that we’ll eventually be able to replicate anything. This would have a phenomenal effect on our society. In time it could even lead to the eradication of famine through the introduction of machines that produce food to feed the hungry. But ti ~s in the area of medicine that nanotechnology may have its biggest impact. How we detect disease will change as tinv biosensors are developed to analyse tests in minutes rather than davs. There’s even speculation nano-robots could be used to slow the ageing process, lengthening life expectancy. As you can see, I’m very excited by the implications that could be available to us in the next few decades. Just how long it’ll take, I honestly don’t know.

TEST 1~WRITING TASK 1
SAMPLE ANSWER
This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 4.5 score. Here is the examiner’s comment:
The response generally addresses the requirements of the task but there is no clear overview. Key features of the two pie charts are presented but not adequately covered, and there is a tendency to focus on details without referring to the bigger picture. Organisation is evident. The relationship of ideas can be followed (and, First, but, Secondly, The former, The latter) but the sentences are not fluently linked to each other. Vocabulary is limited but just adequate for the task. Simple vocabulary is used accurately but the range does not allow much variation in expression. There are noticeable errors in spelling, though these do not cause strain. A limited range of grammatical structures is used; subordinate clauses are rare and most sentences are simple. Even simple sentences often contain errors (The latter have), so grammatical errors are frequent and can cause severe strain for the reader. Control over sentence formation is weak.

MODEL ANSWER
This model has been prepared by an examiner as an example of a very good answer. However, please note that this is just one example out of many possible approaches.
One important stage in a child's growth is certainly the development of a conscience, which is linked to the ability to tell right from wrong. This skill comes with time and good parenting, and my firm conviction is that punishment does not have much of a role to play in this. Therefore I have to disagree almost entirely with the given statement.
To some extent the question depends on the age of the child. To punish a very young child is both wrong and foolish, as an infant will not understand what is happening or why he or she is being punished. Once the age of reason is reached however, a child can be rewarded for good behaviour and discouraged from bad. This kind but firm approach will achieve more than harsh punishments, which might entail many negative consequences unintended by the parents.
To help a child learn the difference between right and wrong, teachers and parents should firstly provide good role modelling in their own behaviour. After that, if sanctions are needed, the punishment should not be of a physical nature, as that merely sends the message that it is acceptable for larger people to hit smaller ones - an outcome which may well result in the child starting to bully others. Nor should the punishment be in any way cruel.
Rather, teachers and parents can use a variety of methods to discipline their young charges, such as detention, withdrawal of privileges, and time-out. Making the punishment fit the crime is a useful notion, which would see children being made to pick up rubbish they have dropped, clean up graffiti they have drawn, or apologise to someone they have hurt. In these ways responsibility is developed in the child, which leads to much better future behaviour than does punishment.

TEST 2~WRITING TASK 1
MODEL ANSWER
This model has been prepared by an examiner as an example of a very good answer. However, please note that this is just one example out of many possible approaches.
The two tables contain sales data for Fairtrade coffee and bananas in 1999 and 2004~in five nations of Europe.
The first table shows low-level coffee sales increasing in all five countries, albeit to widely varying degrees. In two places sales increased by the same small amount: 1.8-2 million euros in Denmark, and 0.8-1 million in Sweden. The increment was slightly larger in Belgium, from 1-1.7 million euros. Meanwhile, in Switzerland sales doubled from 3-6 million euros. Finally, in the UK there was an enormous increase, from 1.5-20 million euros.
In the second table, it is Switzerland which stands out as buying far more Fairtrade bananas than the other four countries. Swiss sales figures jumped from 15—47 million euros across these five years, while in the UK and Belgium sales only grew from 1-5.5 and from 0.6-4 million euros respectively. Sweden and Denmark showed a different pattern, with falls in banana sales from 1 .8-1 and 2-0.9 million euros.
Comparing the two tables, it is clear that in 1999 Fairtrade coffee sales ranged from 0.8-3 million euros in these five countries, while banana sales also mostly clustered between 0.6 and 2 million euros, with Switzerland the outlier at a huge 15 million euros. By 2004, sales figures for both products had risen across the board, except for Sweden and Demark which recorded drops in banana sales.

TEST 2~WRITING TASK 2
SAMPLE ANSWER
This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 3.5 score. Here is the examiner’s comment:
This response is too short at only 232 original words, so does not meet the minimum length required for the task. It is difficult to work out what the writer is trying to say, as his/her position is not made clear. The ideas do seem to be relevant, but problems in the writing mean that no part of the task is adequately addressed. Although some linking words and phrases are used, and the paragraphing looks helpful on the page, the order of information is not coherent and the response does not progress clearly to the end. The vocabulary is basic and the writer has only limited control of word formation. The spelling errors cause strain for the reader. Two lengthy phrases have been copied from the writing question paper. Some complex grammatical structures are attempted but are all faulty. Some simple structures are correct but overall errors predominate. Commas, fullstops and capital letters are misused throughout so punctuation is faulty.

SAMPLE ANSWER
This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 6.5 score. Here is the examiner’s comment:
This response reports the data on the bar charts accurately and gives an extended overview at the end. Information is logically organised and there is a clear progression throughout. The message can be followed with ease as a range of cohesive devices are used flexibly. Referencing and substitution are also well managed, however there are lapses in paragraphing. A range of vocabulary is used with no spelling errors, though word choice is not always appropriate {to seek further study, roughly almost, the percentage on the amount of, overuse of sought). These errors do not detract from overall clarity but they do reduce the communicative effect. A range of complex structures is also used accurately. Error- free sentences are frequent and only a few mistakes occur (The graphs represents, we will notice), so grammar and punctuation are generally well controlled.

TEST 3~WRITING TASK 2 MODEL ANSWER

It is said that countries are becoming similar to each other because of the global spread of the same products, which are now available for purchase almost anywhere. I strongly believe that this modern development is largely detrimental to culture and traditions worldwide.
A country’s history, language and ethos are all inextricably bound up in its manufactured artefacts. If the relentless advance of international brands into every corner of the world continues, these bland packages might one day completely oust the traditional objects of a nation, which would be a loss of richness and diversity in the world, as well as the sad disappearance of the manifestations of a place’s character. What would a Japanese tea ceremony be without its specially crafted teapot, or a Fijian kava ritual without its bowl made from a certain type of tree bark?
Let us not forget either that traditional products, whether these be medicines, cosmetics, toys, clothes, utensils or food, provide employment for local people. The spread of multinational products can often bring in its wake a loss of jobs, as people turn to buying the new brand, perhaps thinking it more glamorous than the one they are used to. This eventually puts old-school craftspeople out of work.
Finally, tourism numbers may also be affected, as travellers become disillusioned with finding every place just the same as the one they visited previously. To see the same products in shops the world over is boring, and does not impel visitors to open their wallets in the same way that trinkets or souvenirs unique to the particular area do.
Some may argue that all people are entitled to have access to the same products, but I say that local objects suit local conditions best, and that faceless uniformity worldwide is an unwelcome and dreary prospect.

This model has been prepared by an examiner as an example of a very good answer. However, please note that this is just one example out of many possible approaches.
Salmon begin life as eggs on a pebbly riverbed, hidden among reeds in the slow- moving upper reaches of a river. After five to six months the eggs hatch into ‘fry’. For approximately the next four years, these baby salmon will live in the lower, faster-flowing waters of their river. During this time they measure between three and eight centimetres in length.
By the time salmon reach twelve to fifteen centimetres, they are termed ‘smolt1, and at this time they migrate further downriver into the open sea. After five years at sea the salmon will have grown to adult size, which is between seventy and seventy-six centimetres. They then begin swimming back to their birthplace, where they will lay their eggs, and the cycle starts anew.
In summary, the salmon passes through three distinct physical stages as it grows to maturity. Each of these stages takes place in a very different aquatic location. It is noteworthy that the first two stages of this fish's life occur in a freshwater environment, while the third stage is lived in saltwater.

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5.5 score. Here is the examiner’s comment:
This script is too short at only 219 words, so fails to meet the minimum word count required by the task. However it does address all parts of the prompt, and presents a relevant position. The main ideas are clear and developed but could be more fully extended and supported. Information is arranged coherently and there is a clear overall progression, with adequate use of linking words (However, also, Usually, since, but, So) and paragraphing. The vocabulary is generally adequate and appropriate for the task [funds， maintain) and meaning is generally clear. However, misuse of the word admission and other slight inappropriacies (doing a charity) show a lack of precision in word choice. Many different complex structures are used but there are still fairly frequent errors. However, these rarely impede communication; in general grammar and punctuation are fairly well controlled.

Dear Sally,
My departure date for New Zealand is drawing near, and I am busy with preparations. I have enrolled at an institution called 'ABC English' in Wellington, for a six-month Advanced course, full-time. It is quite expensive but I am hopeful of improving my pronunciation, especially.
To assist in covering the costs of my study, I aim to find a part-time job. Not only are the college fees rather high, but also I know that rental accommodation in the capital city will not be cheap, to say nothing of food and heating expenses! So I would very much like to arrange some temporary employment before I arrive.
I was wondering if you could ask around among your friends and colleagues to see if anyone wants a house-cleaner, gardener, or nanny for their children. I know you have a wide social network in Wellington which you could canvas for me, if you wouldn’t mind, i’d be so grateful.
I look forward to seeing you soon.
Best wishes,
Margot

SAMPLE ANSWER This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 5 score. Here is the examiner’s comment:
Both parts of the prompt are addressed, although the main ideas and the writer’s position could be better developed. No clear conclusions are drawn so there is a lack of overall progression. Organisation is evident but not always logical, and the sentences are not fluently linked to each other, while each paragraph lacks a clear topic. The vocabulary is limited but minimally adequate, with not much variation in expression, and the frequent spelling errors are noticeable and cause some difficulty for the reader. The range of sentence types is limited and rather repetitive. Complex sentences are attempted but tend to be faulty, and there are a number of basic errors. Punctuation is poorly controlled, with underuse of capital letters and fullstops.

This is an answer written by a candidate who achieved a Band 8 score. Here is the examinees comment:
The response addresses all the bullet points very naturally, and expands fully on two of them. The reason for the celebration is covered at the beginning and the end, but could be more fully developed. The message is easy to follow, ideas are logically sequenced and all aspects of cohesion are well managed. The paragraphing is sufficient but could be improved: the three short, single-sentence paragraphs would be better combined into one. A wide range of vocabulary is fluently used to convey precise meanings. There are several spelling errors which do not reduce the communicative effect. A wide range of grammatical structures is accurately used, with full flexibility and control. Punctuation and grammar are appropriate throughout, with no errors.

MODEL ANSWER
This model has been prepared by an examiner as an example of a very good answer. However, please note that this is just one example out of many possible approaches.
It is true that many parents purchase a multitude of playthings for their offspring. Whether or not this is a good thing for the child, is a moot point. On the face of it the advantages seem most apparent, but could there be a downside to this phenomenon of devoted parenting as well?
Most people would consider children who have many toys to be the fortunate ones. Interesting things to play with stimulate many positives in the young boy or girl, such as optimum brain development, hand-eye coordination and colour recognition, apart from the simple joy of playing. Modern toys are designed to be educational as well as fun, and concerned parents carefully select products which might speed their child’s acquisition of numbers or the alphabet.
Is it possible that owning multiple toys could be in any way detrimental to a child? This is an unusual question, but there are some hidden pitfalls. For one, wealthy parents might spoil their son or daughter by showering him/her with toys, resulting in a negative effect on the child’s character. For another, a growing child's concentration span may suffer if they are constantly surrounded by too many tempting objects, so that they become unable to focus on any one game for a decent length of time before being distracted. On the social side, older children may become targets of envy from classmates, if they are perceived as having far more possessions than their peers. Finally, the majority of toys today are made of plastic which commonly contains the chemical BPA, proven to be dangerous for infants to suck on or ingest.
